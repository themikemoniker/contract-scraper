Shipping, now more than ever, is the backbone of the global economy, but integrating the technology-enabled operations of a modern business with the low-tech and complex shipping industry has always been a challenge. EasyPost solves this problem with the first developer-friendly REST API for shipping, and we continue to push boundaries and discover new ways to simplify shipping for all. Our team is rapidly growing, and this is the perfect time to get on board. Join us and help build the shipping infrastructure of the future. Weâre builders, problem-solvers, and âthere has to be a better wayâ people.

      "description": "<p>ð§¡ð¦ð<span style=\"font-size: 11pt\">Founded in 2012, EasyPost is a YC unicorn whose mission is to make shipping simple for businessesâfrom garage startups to the Fortune 500. Shipping, now more than ever, is the backbone of the global economy, but integrating the technology-enabled operations of a modern business with the low-tech and complex shipping industry has always been a challenge. EasyPost solves this problem with the first developer-friendly REST API for shipping, and we continue to push boundaries and discover new ways to simplify shipping for all. Our team is rapidly growing, and this is the perfect time to get on board. Join us and help build the shipping infrastructure of the future. Weâre builders, problem-solvers, and âthere has to be a better wayâ people. We like elegant architecture, fast decisions, and shipping (pun intended) improvements that power millions of deliveries every day. We stay scrappy, we move fast, and we donât wait for permission to innovate in an industry that desperately needs it.

    "description": "The Organization: Merit America The American economy is broken. Today, 53 million working adultsânearly half of the U.S. workforceâdo not earn a living wage. These talented workers have few options to advance: college is too long and expensive, full-time boot camp programs don't offer enough flexibility, and online courses don't have the structure or support to translate learning into a new career. The result? Talented workers, disproportionately people of color and women, get stuck in low-wage roles with no way to build a better life for themselves and their families. Merit America is a national nonprofit that creates pathways to family-sustaining careers for Americans stuck in low-wage work. Our fast, flexible solutions are built for working adults: We start by analyzing tens of millions of job postings to identify in-demand, high-paying tech careers and then work with industry-recognized partners to train for these roles with part-time programs that combine flexible online learning with best-in-class coaching. Finally, we support our learners in their job search, helping them connect with a broad constellation of local and national employers such as JPMorgan Chase and Infosys to land higher-earning, family-sustaining jobs. Merit America is on a mission to build a scalable pathway for workers to join the middle class through merit, not money. Since our founding in 2018, we've generated a projected $1 billion in near-term wage gains for our learners. Note: Merit America generally operates on a four-day workweek; however, due to the nature of executive support, this role follows a five-day schedule (MondayâFriday).

      "description": "<p><strong>The Organization: Merit America</strong></p>\n<p>The American economy is broken. Today, 53 million working adultsânearly half of the U.S. workforceâdo not earn a living wage. These talented workers have few options to advance: college is too long and expensive, full-time boot camp programs don't offer enough flexibility, and online courses don't have the structure or support to translate learning into a new career. The result? Talented workers, disproportionately people of color and women, get stuck in low-wage roles with no way to build a better life for themselves and their families.</p>\n<p>Merit America is a national nonprofit that creates pathways to family-sustaining careers for Americans stuck in low-wage work. Our fast, flexible solutions are built for working adults: We start by analyzing tens of millions of job postings to identify in-demand, high-paying tech careers and then work with industry-recognized partners to train for these roles with part-time programs that combine flexible online learning with best-in-class coaching. Finally, we support our learners in their job search, helping them connect with a broad constellation of local and national employers such as JPMorgan Chase and Infosys to land higher-earning, family-sustaining jobs. Merit America is on a mission to build a scalable pathway for workers to join the middle class through merit, not money. Since our founding in 2018, we've generated a projected $1 billion in near-term wage gains for our learners.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Merit America generally operates on a four-day workweek; however, due to the nature of executive support, this role follows a five-day schedule (MondayâFriday).</em></p>\n<p><strong>Role Overview:</strong></p>\n<p>The primary mission of the Executive Assistant to the Co-CEOs is to support the Co-CEOs in working as efficiently and effectively as possible, managing complex calendars, coordinating executive travel, streamlining operations<br/><br/>Please mention the word **LUCIDLY** and tag RMzQuOTYuNDcuMjEx when applying to show you read the job post completely (#RMzQuOTYuNDcuMjEx).

    "description": "Weâre not just building better tech. Weâre rewriting how data moves and what the world can do with it. With Confluent, data doesnât sit still. Our platform puts information in motion, streaming in near real-time so companies can react faster, build smarter, and deliver experiences as dynamic as the world around them. It takes a certain kind of person to join this team. Those who ask hard questions, give honest feedback, and show up for each other. No egos, no solo acts. Just smart, curious humans pushing toward something bigger, together. One Confluent. One Team. One Data Streaming Platform. About the Role: The Partner Applied Solutions (PAS) team is part of Confluentâs Partner &amp; Technology Group, which exists to drive cross-functional innovation, productivity, and partner success through deep event streaming expertise. PAS engineers focus on building partner-enabling tools, frameworks, and systems that bridge the gap between core products and customer solutions. These are engineered assets designed to scale, evolve, and help partners and Confluent teams deliver robust, consistent, and verified event streaming solutions. The team operates as a small, high-impact engineering group: pragmatic, technical, and deeply integrated with Confluentâs partner and product ecosystem. As a Senior Engineer in the Partner Applied Solutions team, your first assignment will be to help design and build the platform, services, and workflows that powers Confluent Marketplace end-to-end. Youâll work across: Confluent Cloud APIs and control plane Partner and internal services that publish and manage listings Confluent Marketplace UI and back-end flows for discovery, try/buy, provisioning, and metering Your work will enable partners to launch high-quality offerings quickly, and make it radically simpler for customers to adopt those offerings as part of their event streaming architecture. This role is ideal for someone who enjoys building productized platforms , owning end-to-end flows , and working closely with both internal stakeholders and external partners to shape how the Confluent ecosystem scales. What You Will Do: Design and build confluent marketplace platform services that power listing management, entitlement, provisioning, and lifecycle events for partner offerings. Implement end-to-end flows for how customers discover, evaluate, and adopt marketplace solutions directly from Confluent Cloud. Integrate with internal and external systems (e.g., billing, identity, metering, partner APIs) to provide a seamless marketplace experience. Develop tools and APIs for partners to onboard, validate, publish, and maintain their listings with clear quality and compliance guardrails. Own the lifecycle of features and services from design and prototyping through rollout, observability, and continuous improvement. Collaborate closely with Product, Partner Engineering, and GTM teams to translate partner and customer needs into platform capabilities that scale. Contribute to engineering standards and architecture for the marketplace, ensuring services are maintainable, secure, and resilient. Participate in design and code reviews , help shape technical direction, and mentor peers where appropriate. What You Will Bring: Strong backend engineering experience , ideally in Java (experience with Go, Python, or similar languages is a plus). Solid understanding of distributed systems and service design , including APIs, data modeling, and asynchronous workflows. Experience building productized internal or external platforms (marketplaces, app stores, partner platforms, or similar). Familiarity with event-driven architecture and streaming systems (Apache Kafka / Confluent Cloud experience is strongly preferred). Strong grounding in cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes). Comfort working with security, identity, and integration surfaces (authentication/authorization, webhooks, partner APIs). Excellent collaboration and communication skills , with the ability to align and deliver across Product, Engineering, and partner-facing teams. What Gives You an Edge: Experience with commercial or technical marketplaces , app stores, or SaaS ecosystems. Hands-on experience with Kafka connectors, data integration systems, or data products that would commonly appear in a marketplace.

We power some of the most advanced AI teams in the world by giving them the flexibility to move fast, scale confidently, and stay future-proof as models evolve. As enterprise adoption of AI accelerates, OpenRouter sits at the center of how organizations operationalize LLMs across research, product, and production workloads. About the Role We're hiring our first Security Engineer to own the process of safeguarding our systems, infrastructure, applications, and data. As the first security hire, you will build out our security operations and vulnerability management process for our AI gateway platform. You'll implement programs, run tooling, ship security fixes, and drive remediation across our stack. Youâll be responsible for all aspects of ensuring the security of our platform and users. This isn't a compliance paperwork role; it's a hands-on security position with direct impact on how we protect millions of API requests daily. You'll work closely with engineering and senior leadership to ship security improvements that actually matter. What You'll Do Deploy and operate vulnerability scanning across our cloud infrastructure. Triage findings and drive remediation with engineering teams. Lead security assessments for internal and customer security needs (e.g. SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, HIPAA audits). Maintain vulnerability and remediation documentation for auditors. Act as a liaison between product, engineering, compliance, and GTM to guide and prioritize the right security investments. Perform penetration tests, tabletop exercises, DR testing, and incident response. Manage endpoint security tooling as we scale; conduct audit log reviews and maintain visibility across our stack. About You 3-5+ years in security engineering or operations. Deep knowledge of cloud security and expertise in operating in a cloud-hosted environment. Comfortable in compliance-heavy environments (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA). Strong experience with SIEM platforms (Splunk, Elastic, Panther) and vulnerability scanners (e.g. Qualys, Tenable, Rapid7). AI-forward with hands-on experience adopting, leveraging, and integrating AI tools. Startup mindset; you thrive building programs from the ground up and not just inheriting existing playbooks.

We power some of the most advanced AI teams in the world by giving them the flexibility to move fast, scale confidently, and stay future-proof as models evolve. As enterprise adoption of AI accelerates, OpenRouter sits at the center of how organizations operationalize LLMs across research, product, and production workloads. The Role Weâre looking for a Developer Relations Lead to become the trusted voice of developer education for OpenRouter. You will be the person developers think of when they think about learning how to integrate with OpenRouter and how to design, evaluate, and operate multi-model AI systems in production. You are a developer first. You understand AI infrastructure deeply, youâve built with LLMs, and youâre fluent in the tradeoffs developers face when choosing models, architectures, and tooling. You will build and scale OpenRouterâs developer education presence across YouTube, Twitter/X, Discord, Reddit, and other community channelsâhelping developers make better architectural decisions and use OpenRouter effectively. This is a hands-on, founding DevRel role. In year one, you will be the primary creator and community presence, with the opportunity to shape how the function scales over time. This role is not about selling. It is about education, community trust, and establishing OpenRouter as the default learning resource for AI builders. What Youâll Do Developer Education: Define and execute OpenRouterâs developer education strategy across YouTube, Twitter/X, Discord, Reddit, and other community channels. Technical Content : Create high-quality tutorials, videos, guides, code examples, and reference architectures focused on real production use cases. Community Engagement : Be deeply present in developer communities and OpenRouterâs Discordâanswering questions, spotting patterns, and building trust. Developer Advocacy : Synthesize developer feedback into actionable insights for product and engineering teams. Thought Leadership : Represent OpenRouter publicly through talks, writing, and community discussions on AI architecture and multi-model systems. Collaboration : Partner with Product Marketing, Engineering, and Support to ensure educational content is accurate, discoverable, and aligned (without owning support SLAs or launches). What Success Looks Like (First 12 Months) OpenRouter is consistently referenced as a canonical resource for multi-model AI architecture and model selection. A small number of high-quality tutorials, repos, or videos become default entry points for new developers. Developer questions in community channels are increasingly answered by peers, not just staff. Clear, actionable developer insights regularly inform product decisions and roadmap prioritization. What Weâre Looking For 5+ years of experience in developer relations, developer education, or a closely related technical role. Experience at a developer tools company, infrastructure platform, or API-first product. Proven track record creating technical educational content that drives real developer adoption. Deep hands-on understanding of AI/ML, LLMs, APIs, and modern developer workflows. Strong written and verbal communication skills; able to explain complex systems clearly. Comfort with public speaking and representing a company in technical forums and events. Self-directed and entrepreneurial; able to define problems, identify leverage, and execute independently. Comfortable being publicly visible and camera-ready as a representative of OpenRouter. Nice to Have Experience building or scaling developer communities. Background running workshops, hackathons, or structured education programs. Familiarity with OpenRouter or public writing/speaking on multi-model AI approaches. Experience with video production, streaming, or multimedia technical content Why OpenRouter Work at the center of the AI infrastructure stack as enterprises define how they adopt LLMs. High ownership and autonomy to define how developer education and community scale. Opportunity to shape a foundational function at a fast-growing company. Fully remote team with a culture of autonomy and trust. Competitive compensation, including base salary and equity.
