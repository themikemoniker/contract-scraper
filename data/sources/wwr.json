    "description": "Headquarters: Anywhere URL: http://https:/jiga.io/about-us What we're building Jiga &nbsp;is on a mission to help engineers build physical products faster. Think&nbsp; npm install &nbsp;for mechanical engineers - we're building the infrastructure that makes hardware development as fast as software. How we actually work We’re a small remote team made up of the best of the best. Our team members are distributed around the globe. While most of our product and engineering talent is located in Europe and Israel, you’ll also work with people from the US and Asia. Most of our work is made async, which is the secret sauce of our success. High trust, low bullshit: &nbsp;We don't count hours or peek over your shoulder on Slack. We trust you to get your work done and tell us when something's wrong. You'll have real ownership over what you build: which means you'll make a lot of decisions about architecture and functionality without endless approval cycles. (If that sounds terrifying, we're probably not a good fit. If that sounds exciting, keep reading.) Question everything: &nbsp;See something that doesn't make sense? Say it. Have a better way to do something? Just do it. We actually mean it when we say we want people to challenge the status quo and improve things. Our internal motto is “Don’t drink the kool-aid” No stupid Meetings: &nbsp;One weekly all-hands. One dev team sync. That's literally it. Everything else happens async in Slack or Loom. Your calendar will be beautifully, gloriously empty. Actually friendly, not corporate friendly: &nbsp;We play games online every week (current favorite: Make it Meme). Once a year we fly everyone somewhere beautiful for our offsite (Greece, here we come). We genuinely like hanging out together, which turns out to be way better than forced \"team building exercises.\" What we value in engineering: Simple &gt; Complicated. &nbsp;Simple code, simple architecture; Simple solutions are better than complex ones. Ship it, then improve it. &nbsp;Perfection is the enemy of done. Launch now, iterate forever. Product &gt; Engineering. &nbsp;Every line of code should make our users' lives better. We're not here to show off our algorithmic prowess - we're here to solve real business problems. Financials Jiga is fully funded, cashflow positive, with growing revenue MoM. We're completely transparent about our runway and finances - ask us anything. You'll love it here if You want to actually own things. &nbsp;Not \"ownership\" where you need three approvals to change a button color. Real ownership where you decide what to build, how to build it, and when to ship it. You're genuinely full-stack &nbsp;- you're equally happy building a slick UI component or optimizing a database query. There's no task you'd refuse because it's \"not your specialty.\" You care about the product, not just the code . You want to understand&nbsp; why &nbsp;we're building something and you'll push back if it doesn't make sense. You are motivated to run a marathon &nbsp;and ring the bell with us in 3-4 years from now. Bureaucracy makes you want to scream . Multiple approval layers, process for the sake of process, corporate theatre - if these sound like your nightmare, welcome home. You love shipping. &nbsp;Like, you get genuinely excited when you push to production. That \"it's alive!\" feeling never gets old. You work fast &nbsp;because you're having fun, not because someone's watching you. This might not be for you if You hate ambiguity. You prefer clear, detailed task assignments and well-defined requirements You like having management to check in, review and verify your work multiple times until it’s perfect You're looking for a cuddly, 9-5, corporate job where you can coast a bit You like the smell of gasoline and motor oil while driving to the office every day (sorry, we are 100% remote) You like weeks of architecting over-complicated solutions (No judgment if that's what you want - it's just not what we are.) What you need 3+ years building full-stack web applications end-to-end Strong at React + Node.js. MongoDB experience is a great plus. Experience building complex applications - you understand clean architecture, security, scaling, performance, and maintainability Solid data modeling fundamentals Product company experience (you've felt the joy and pain of real users) Some overlap with GMT+3 working hours so we can actually talk to you sometimes What we offer No ping pong tables. No beer kegs. No \"unlimited vacation\" that nobody takes. No ice cream fridge at the office. Oh right, we don't even have an office. Here's what we do have: A small team where you matter &nbsp;- we never compromise on people, that means you are part of the best team in the world.

Think&nbsp;<code>npm install</code>&nbsp;for mechanical engineers - we're building the infrastructure that makes hardware development as fast as software.</p>\n<h3><strong>How we actually work</strong></h3>\n<p>We’re a small remote team made up of the best of the best. Our team members are distributed around the globe. While most of our product and engineering talent is located in Europe and Israel, you’ll also work with people from the US and Asia. Most of our work is made async, which is the secret sauce of our success.</p>\n<p><strong>High trust, low bullshit:</strong>&nbsp;We don't count hours or peek over your shoulder on Slack. We trust you to get your work done and tell us when something's wrong. You'll have real ownership over what you build: which means you'll make a lot of decisions about architecture and functionality without endless approval cycles. (If that sounds terrifying, we're probably not a good fit. If that sounds exciting, keep reading.)</p>\n<p><strong>Question everything:</strong>&nbsp;See something that doesn't make sense? Say it. Have a better way to do something? Just do it. We actually mean it when we say we want people to challenge the status quo and improve things. Our internal motto is “Don’t drink the kool-aid”</p>\n<p><strong>No stupid Meetings:</strong>&nbsp;One weekly all-hands. One dev team sync. That's literally it. Everything else happens async in Slack or Loom. Your calendar will be beautifully, gloriously empty.</p>\n<p><strong>Actually friendly, not corporate friendly:</strong>&nbsp;We play games online every week (current favorite: Make it Meme). Once a year we fly everyone somewhere beautiful for our offsite (Greece, here we come). We genuinely like hanging out together, which turns out to be way better than forced \"team building exercises.\"</p>\n<p><strong>What we value in engineering:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Simple &gt; Complicated.</strong>&nbsp;Simple code, simple architecture; Simple solutions are better than complex ones.</p>\n<p><strong>Ship it, then improve it.</strong>&nbsp;Perfection is the enemy of done. Launch now, iterate forever.</p>\n<p><strong>Product &gt; Engineering.</strong>&nbsp;Every line of code should make our users' lives better. We're not here to show off our algorithmic prowess - we're here to solve real business problems.</p>\n<h3><strong>Financials</strong></h3>\n<p>Jiga is fully funded, cashflow positive, with growing revenue MoM. We're completely transparent about our runway and finances - ask us anything.</p>\n<h3><strong>You'll love it here if</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You want to actually own things.</strong>&nbsp;Not \"ownership\" where you need three approvals to change a button color. Real ownership where you decide what to build, how to build it, and when to ship it.</li>\n<li><strong>You're genuinely full-stack</strong>&nbsp;- you're equally happy building a slick UI component or optimizing a database query. There's no task you'd refuse because it's \"not your specialty.\"</li>\n<li><strong>You care about the product, not just the code</strong>. You want to understand&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;we're building something and you'll push back if it doesn't make sense.</li>\n<li><strong>You are motivated to run a marathon</strong>&nbsp;and ring the bell with us in 3-4 years from now.</li>\n<li><strong>Bureaucracy makes you want to scream</strong>. Multiple approval layers, process for the sake of process, corporate theatre - if these sound like your nightmare, welcome home.</li>\n<li><strong>You love shipping.</strong>&nbsp;Like, you get genuinely excited when you push to production. That \"it's alive!\" feeling never gets old.</li>\n<li><strong>You work fast</strong>&nbsp;because you're having fun, not because someone's watching you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>This might not be for you if</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You hate ambiguity. You prefer clear, detailed task assignments and well-defined requirements</li>\n<li>You like having management to check in, review and verify your work multiple times until it’s perfect</li>\n<li>You're looking for a cuddly, 9-5, corporate job where you can coast a bit</li>\n<li>You like the smell of gasoline and motor oil while driving to the office every day (sorry, we are 100% remote)</li>\n<li>You like weeks of architecting over-complicated solutions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(No judgment if that's what you want - it's just not what we are.)</p>\n<h3><strong>What you need</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>3+ years building full-stack web applications end-to-end</li>\n<li>Strong at React + Node.js. MongoDB experience is a great plus.</li>\n<li>Experience building complex applications - you understand clean architecture, security, scaling, performance, and maintainability</li>\n<li>Solid data modeling fundamentals</li>\n<li>Product company experience (you've felt the joy and pain of real users)</li>\n<li>Some overlap with GMT+3 working hours so we can actually talk to you sometimes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>What we offer</strong></h3>\n<p>No ping pong tables. No beer kegs. No \"unlimited vacation\" that nobody takes. No ice cream fridge at the office. Oh right, we don't even have an office.</p>\n<p>Here's what we do have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A small team where you matter</strong>&nbsp;- we never compromise on people, that means you are part of the best team in the world.</li>\n<li><strong>Zero bureaucracy</strong>&nbsp;- we hate process theatre as much as you do</li>\n<li><strong>Real ownership and responsibility</strong>&nbsp;- make decisions, ship code, own the outcomes. Have real impact on the product from day 1.</li>\n<li><strong>Complete flexibility</strong>&nbsp;- work from anywhere, set your own hours, take time off when you need it (parents and DMs are very welcome)</li>\n<li><strong>Genuinely high trust</strong>&nbsp;- we trust you to do great work and be honest when things go sideways</li>\n<li><strong>A team that actually likes each other</strong>&nbsp;- international, diverse, genuinely friendly people who enjoy working together</li>\n<li><strong>Generous stock options</strong>&nbsp;- we’re looking for partners to run a marathon with us, you will get a life-changing shares when we get to the finish line</li>\n<li><strong>Competitive salary and PTOs</strong>&nbsp;- so you can also enjoy, relax and recharge</li>\n<li><strong>Self-development budget</strong>&nbsp;for books, courses, conferences, whatever helps you grow</li>\n<li><strong>Annual offsite</strong>&nbsp;in beautiful places (greece, here we come!)</li>\n<li><strong>Fast-paced environment</strong>&nbsp;with tons of creative freedom</li>\n<li>Hard, interesting problems with a&nbsp;<strong>team that's positioned to win big</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>To apply:</strong> <a href=\"https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/jiga-full-stack-product-engineer\">https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/jiga-full-stack-product-engineer</a></p>",

We're a bootstrapped company so there's no VCs to answer to.&nbsp; That doesn't mean we're not ambitious though - there's a massive market we're going after and we want to create lasting change.&nbsp; As a combination of these two things we've a heavy focus on getting stuff done. Our development ethos could be best described as \"full DHH\". Whilst there's some bits we don't 100% agree with we stick to the core Rails ethos and stack, focussing on what we can achieve with the technology, rather than the technology itself.&nbsp; If you've enjoyed some of the blog posts on how Basecamp structure code, or enjoy the work of boringrails.com, you'd like working with us. We're a small (but mighty) tech team of 4 so you'll be jumping straight in and writing code for customers from day 1. There's also infrastructure/UI work/mobile app development work that happens and you can become involved in if you so wish.&nbsp; The role has the opportunity to build into a CTO role for the right person. A little more about the role and us: It's really refreshing using technology to do something that helps people in a real world tangible way.&nbsp; Changing lives and increasing health through technology is very motivating! We love simplicity.&nbsp; We're fanatical about it.&nbsp; This goes from our codebase, to our infrastructure, to how we operate as a company.&nbsp; It can be harder work upfront but it sure makes life easier down the road. You'll need strong ownership skills.&nbsp; As a small team we don't have project managers.&nbsp; You're responsible for your tasks so you'll need to be good at taking ownership and reporting back to the team. An ability to renegotiate requirements as you get into the technical details is most welcome!&nbsp; In Computer Science there's hard problems and hard problems that don't need solving.&nbsp; We are constantly asking ourselves if there's an easier way to do something. We spend a lot of time talking to our customers and understanding their problems.&nbsp; This won't ever change.&nbsp; Be prepared to go back and evaluate previously held assumptions on new features after testing with beta customers The position is fulltime and by no means do you need to be into health/fitness to work here (only about 50% of our staff are).&nbsp; It's fully remote position but you'd need to be on an EU timezone so there's sufficient overlap with the rest of the team.&nbsp; We also do a full team meetup in person twice per year.

    "description": "Headquarters: San Francisco URL: https://posthog.com/ About PostHog We're shipping every product that companies need to run their business from their first day, to the day they IPO, and beyond. The operating system for folks who build software. We started with open-source product analytics,&nbsp; launched out of Y Combinator's W20 cohort. We've since shipped more than a dozen products &nbsp;including: A built-in data warehouse , so users can query product and customer data together using custom SQL insights. A customer data platform , so they can send their data wherever they need with ease. PostHog AI , an AI-powered analyst that answers product questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and writes custom SQL queries. Next on the roadmap are CRM, messaging, revenue analytics, and support products. When we say every product that companies need to run their business, we really mean it! We are: 1. Product-led . More than 100,000 companies have installed PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely strong product-market fit. 2. Default alive . Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and grow faster, not to keep the lights on. 3. Well-funded . We've raised more than $100m from some of the world's top investors . We're set up for a long, ambitious journey. We're focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and&nbsp; being as weird as possible . Things we care about Transparency : Everyone can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, our strategy, and how we work, in our public company handbook . Internally, we share revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need to make good decisions. Autonomy : We don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what's going to have the biggest impact on our customers, and what they find interesting and motivating to work on. Engineers lead product teams and make product decisions . Teams are flexible and easy to change when needed. Shipping fast : Why not now? We want to build a lot of products; we can't do that shipping at a normal pace. We've built the company around small teams – autonomous, highly-efficient groups of cracked engineers who can outship much larger companies because they own their products end-to-end. Time for building : Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're a natively remote company. We default to async communication – PRs &gt; Issues &gt; Slack. Tuesdays and Thursdays are&nbsp; meeting-free days , and we prioritize heads down building time over perfect coordination. This will be the most productive job you've ever had. Ambition : We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic about what's possible and our ability to get there. Being weird : Weird means redesigning an already world-class website for the 5th time. It means shipping literally every product that relates to customer data. It means building an objectively unnecessary developer toy with dubious shareholder value. Doing weird stuff is a competitive advantage. And it's fun. Who we're looking for We’re looking for a full-stack engineer who knows how to leverage LLMs to make PostHog 10x more powerful. You’ve built and shipped agentic AI applications before and understand it’s more than just hitting an API with a good prompt. You’ll fit right in if you: Ship end-to-end AI apps — from backend infra to frontend UX. Collaborate widely — work across teams, find the right people, and make progress fast. Think like a product builder — care about users and outcomes, not just code. If you’ve worked in autonomous agents, workflow automation, or AI copilots before, you’ll feel at home — but here you’ll get to build it from scratch, in the open, with massive impact. What makes this role unique In this role, you’re not hacking together an AI agent hoping someone will use it — you’re building on top of a firehose of real customer data with immediate impact, whether that means creating new AI-powered tools or building observability features that help others understand how their agents perform in the wild. Impact from day one: You’re building agents on top of real customer data — not toy demos, not “when we get users.” Data advantage: PostHog already collects all the context agents need to be useful: analytics, sessions, events, feature flags, and more. You’ll build on top of it all. Agents that matter: Instead of copilots on the side, you’ll create background agents embedded into engineering workflows - changing how software gets built. Or, you might focus on building the analytics and observability layer around those agents - surfacing insights, clustering behaviors, and measuring model quality so teams can improve their own AI systems with confidence. Build in the open: Work with feedback from the largest open-source product engineering communities in the world. What you'll be doing Owning products and features from beginning to end. This means originating ideas based on your intuition, talking to users, and understanding our strategy and goals. It means testing MVPs in production with real users. It means&nbsp; iterating on their feedback , owning pricing, and ensuring the ongoing success of your work. Collaborating with design (when necessary). Product engineers at PostHog are full-stack, so we expect you to ship and own the basic UX of your work using&nbsp; our design system . From there, it's up to you to decide when to collaborate with our design team to iterate and polish the experience. Implementing AI features . LLMs, eh? They're getting&nbsp; prettaaay, prettaay good . All our products integrate with PostHog AI, so you'll likely be working with the PostHog AI team to implement AI features in your products. For some teams, that means designing observability and evaluation features for AI products. Talking to users . Good product engineers read feedback from users and iterate quickly. Great product engineers have users they're friendly with, talk with them frequently, bounce ideas off them, and iterate with them when they ship new things. Doing support. Every week, one person in each engineering team is designated the Support hero. Their job is to investigate and resolve issues reported by customers for their product. Giving users support from real engineers and shipping fixes and improvements in real-time is one of the best ways to spark joy in users. This role will also include some on-call time , too. Writing docs . We have a content team that will collaborate with you on reviewing, polishing, and improving your documentation, but the best person to document a new feature is the person who built it. Requirements Full-stack experience with relevant technologies – e.g. Python or similar, React or similar, something to do with big data is a bonus. Prior experience in AI workflow automation, copilots, or autonomous agent products. Ability to choose pragmatic architectures, ship quickly, and iterate based on real feedback. Strong sense for UX and product polish. Excellent communicator who thrives on collaboration across teams. Nice to have Have worked at a high-growth SaaS company before. Extensive knowledge of Django and/or TypeScript-based React. Experience building AI-native products or integrating AI into existing software. If you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we can make the interview process better for you - we're happy to accommodate!

The operating system for folks who build software.</p>\n<p>We started with open-source product analytics,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/story\">launched out of Y Combinator's W20 cohort.</a> We've since shipped <a href=\"https://posthog.com/products\">more than a dozen products</a>&nbsp;including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://posthog.com/docs/data-warehouse\">A built-in data warehouse</a>, so users can query product and customer data together using custom SQL insights.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://posthog.com/docs/cdp\">A customer data platform</a>, so they can send their data wherever they need with ease.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://posthog.com/ai\">PostHog AI</a>, an AI-powered analyst that answers product questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and writes custom SQL queries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next on the roadmap are CRM, messaging, revenue analytics, and support products. When we say every product that companies need to run their business, we really mean it!</p>\n<p>We are:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Product-led</strong>. More than 100,000 companies have installed PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely strong product-market fit.<br>2. <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/aord.html\"><strong>Default alive</strong></a>. Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and grow faster, not to keep the lights on.<br>3. <strong>Well-funded</strong>. We've raised more than $100m from some of the world's top <a href=\"https://posthog.com/about\">investors</a>. We're set up for a long, ambitious journey.</p>\n<p>We're focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posthog.com/deskhog\">being as weird as possible</a>.</p>\n<h3>Things we care about</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Everyone can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, our strategy, and how we work, in our <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook\">public company handbook</a>. Internally, we share revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need to make good decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: We don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what's going to have the biggest impact on our customers, and what they find interesting and motivating to work on. <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/wide-company\">Engineers lead product teams</a> and <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/which-products\">make product decisions</a>. Teams are flexible and easy to change when needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Shipping fast</strong>: <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/values#why-not-now\">Why not now?</a> We want to build a lot of products; we can't do that shipping at a normal pace. We've built the company around small teams – autonomous, highly-efficient groups of <a href=\"https://posthog.com/founders/cracked-manifesto\">cracked engineers</a> who can outship much larger companies because they own their products end-to-end.</li>\n<li><strong>Time for building</strong>: Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're a natively remote company. We default to async communication – PRs &gt; Issues &gt; Slack. Tuesdays and Thursdays are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture#were-on-the-makers-schedule\">meeting-free days</a>, and we prioritize heads down building time over perfect coordination. This will be the most productive job you've ever had.</li>\n<li><strong>Ambition</strong>: We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic about what's possible and our ability to get there.</li>\n<li><strong>Being weird</strong>: Weird means redesigning an already world-class website for the 5th time. It means shipping literally every product that relates to customer data. It means building an <a href=\"https://posthog.com/deskhog\">objectively unnecessary developer toy</a> with dubious shareholder value. Doing weird stuff is a competitive advantage. And it's fun.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who we're looking for</h3>\n<p>We’re looking for a full-stack engineer who knows how to leverage LLMs to make PostHog 10x more powerful. You’ve built and shipped agentic AI applications before and understand it’s more than just hitting an API with a good prompt.</p>\n<p>You’ll fit right in if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ship end-to-end AI apps — from backend infra to frontend UX.</li>\n<li>Collaborate widely — work across teams, find the right people, and make progress fast.</li>\n<li>Think like a product builder — care about users and outcomes, not just code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’ve worked in autonomous agents, workflow automation, or AI copilots before, you’ll feel at home — but here you’ll get to build it from scratch, in the open, with massive impact.</p>\n<h3>What makes this role unique</h3>\n<p>In this role, you’re not hacking together an AI agent hoping someone will use it — you’re building on top of a firehose of real customer data with immediate impact, whether that means creating new AI-powered tools or building observability features that help others understand how their agents perform in the wild.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Impact from day one: You’re building agents on top of real customer data — not toy demos, not “when we get users.”</li>\n<li>Data advantage: PostHog already collects all the context agents need to be useful: analytics, sessions, events, feature flags, and more. You’ll build on top of it all.</li>\n<li>Agents that matter: Instead of copilots on the side, you’ll create background agents embedded into engineering workflows - changing how software gets built. Or, you might focus on building the analytics and observability layer around those agents - surfacing insights, clustering behaviors, and measuring model quality so teams can improve their own AI systems with confidence.</li>\n<li>Build in the open: Work with feedback from the largest open-source product engineering communities in the world.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What you'll be doing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Owning products and features from beginning to end.</strong> This means originating ideas based on your intuition, talking to users, and understanding our strategy and goals. It means testing MVPs in production with real users. It means&nbsp;<a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/product-engineering\">iterating on their feedback</a>, owning pricing, and ensuring the ongoing success of your work.</li>\n<li><strong>Collaborating with design (when necessary).</strong> Product engineers at PostHog are full-stack, so we expect you to ship and own the basic UX of your work using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://storybook.posthog.net/?path=/story/exporter-funnels--funnel-left-to-right-insight\">our design system</a>. From there, it's up to you to decide when to <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/product-design\">collaborate with our design team</a> to iterate and polish the experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Implementing AI features</strong>. LLMs, eh? They're getting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRz8-EXlhBo\">prettaaay, prettaay good</a>. All our products integrate with PostHog AI, so you'll likely be <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/working-with-max-ai\">working with the PostHog AI team</a> to implement AI features in your products. For some teams, that means designing observability and evaluation features for AI products.</li>\n<li><strong>Talking to users</strong>. Good product engineers read feedback from users and iterate quickly. Great product engineers have users they're friendly with, talk with them frequently, bounce ideas off them, and iterate with them when they ship new things.</li>\n<li><strong>Doing support.</strong> Every week, one person in each engineering team is designated the <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/operations/support-hero\">Support hero.</a> Their job is to investigate and resolve issues reported by customers for their product. Giving users support from real engineers and shipping fixes and improvements in real-time is one of the best ways to spark joy in users. This role will also include some<a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/operations/on-call-rotation\"> on-call time</a>, too.</li>\n<li><strong>Writing docs</strong>. We have a content team that will collaborate with you on reviewing, polishing, and improving your documentation, but the best person to document a new feature is the person who built it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Full-stack experience with <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/stack\">relevant technologies</a> – e.g. Python or similar, React or similar, something to do with big data is a bonus.</li>\n<li>Prior experience in AI workflow automation, copilots, or autonomous agent products.</li>\n<li>Ability to choose pragmatic architectures, ship quickly, and iterate based on real feedback.</li>\n<li>Strong sense for UX and product polish.</li>\n<li>Excellent communicator who thrives on collaboration across teams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Nice to have</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have worked at a high-growth SaaS company before.</li>\n<li>Extensive knowledge of Django and/or TypeScript-based React.</li>\n<li>Experience building AI-native products or integrating AI into existing software.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we can make the interview process better for you - we're happy to accommodate!</p>\n\n<p><strong>To apply:</strong> <a href=\"https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/posthog-ai-product-engineer\">https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/posthog-ai-product-engineer</a></p>",

This is a&nbsp; Player-Coach &nbsp;role, meaning you'll balance hands-on technical contributions with people management, mentoring, and ensuring your team is aligned with the company's business priorities. &nbsp; If you thrive on both writing great code and fostering an environment where engineers can grow and do their best work—especially in the complex domain of data ingestion and API management—this is for you. &nbsp; Impact : Guide Team Syncs, a mission-critical team responsible for bringing complex financial data into Silverfin and ensuring its accuracy. Challenge : Work with 30+ external APIs, financial algorithms, and manage a public API for external integrations.

Growth : Participate in our Leadership Development Programme and receive a €1200 yearly budget for professional development. Perks : Two engineering retreats per year somewhere in Europe and ten company-wide Wellbeing Days per year (a paid Friday off). A Note about Compensation For this role, the compensation range is €112.000 - €169.000 a year , which reflects the total compensation band for Team Leads at this level. &nbsp; Please note: Most candidates start at the lower to mid part of the range, depending on experience and how their profile compares to our existing team. The higher end of the range is typically offered to individuals with a track record of strong impact and deep expertise in similar roles. We run annual compensation reviews, so there is clear opportunity for growth as you progress in the role. Our Commitment to a Welcoming &amp; Inclusive Process At Silverfin, we are committed to building a&nbsp; diverse, equitable, and inclusive&nbsp; organisation. We value all our colleagues and do not discriminate based on race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability status, or any other characteristic. &nbsp; We believe the best solutions come from diverse perspectives. To ensure an equitable hiring process, our policy is to only move to the interviewing stage once we have a sufficiently representative and diverse pool of applicants. This might mean a slight delay in scheduling interviews, but it's a vital step in our commitment to genuine equity. We strongly encourage you to apply even if you don't check every single box. We are looking for potential and unique contributions. Tell us how you can help us achieve our mission! &nbsp; What You'll Be Doing (Leading Team Syncs) As the Team Lead for&nbsp; Team Syncs , you will manage, mentor, and contribute to a team focused on the backbone of our platform—data connectivity and integrity. People Leadership &amp; Alignment (The Coach) Manage and mentor&nbsp; a team of engineers, fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement. Collaborate closely with the team’s Product Manager to set clear goals and priorities for data synchronization and API development. Partner with &nbsp;Team #1 &nbsp;of your fellow TLs to maintain a well-aligned Engineering department. Live the&nbsp; Silverfin values &nbsp;and be a role model for your team. Technical Contribution (The Player) Actively contribute to the team's codebase, dividing time between technical work and people management. Oversee the&nbsp; development and maintenance of integrations with external bookkeeping APIs , ensuring reliable and accurate data flow. Guide the team in maintaining our&nbsp; public Sync API , enabling third parties to build seamless bookkeeping integrations with Silverfin. Help the team refine algorithms and financial calculations necessary for &nbsp;data accuracy and correctness&nbsp; within the platform. Help with discovery and delivery of the best solutions for customer and business challenges. &nbsp; What We're Looking For Essential Requirements 2 years of experience&nbsp; leading a team, including direct people management. Recent hands-on experience as a&nbsp; Senior Software Engineer. Expertise with or willingness to quickly learn and work with &nbsp;Ruby on Rails. Enthusiasm and familiarity with AI tools for software development. Ability to communicate clearly in&nbsp; English , both verbally and in writing. Work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (local timezone within &nbsp;CET +/- 3h ). Willingness and ability to travel &nbsp;3 to 4 times per year &nbsp;for team and company events. Helpful Experience (Nice-to-Haves) Experience with&nbsp; API design&nbsp; and building resilient, third-party integrations (highly relevant for Team Syncs). Experience in a fully remote working environment. Experience working with large datasets and ensuring data integrity. Experience in Fintech or with accounting/financial knowledge (highly relevant for the team's function). Experience with JavaScript framework(s). &nbsp; What Makes Silverfin Engineering Special Our Technology and Impact The Product: &nbsp;We apply software to automate the busywork of accounting, allowing our 15,000+ users to focus on other valuable aspects of the accountant role such as client advisory. The Stack: &nbsp;We run an up-to-date&nbsp; Rails monolith &nbsp;with PostgreSQL and Redis on a &nbsp;Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud , with a number of satellite services - such as our AI applications. We follow a&nbsp; DevOps mindset —developers and ops work together to empower self-sufficiency. The Challenge:&nbsp; Our biggest stack includes a database exceeding 17TB, with tables over 10 billion rows, requiring careful thought on scalability and performance—especially crucial for&nbsp; Team Syncs'&nbsp; data ingestion role. Product Focus &amp; Empowerment: &nbsp;We are organised into empowered cross-functional teams with software or AI engineers, product managers and product designers. Each team has a high-level mission and a lot of agency in deciding how to achieve it. Innovation:&nbsp; We have an in-house &nbsp;AI team &nbsp;applying machine learning to solve real client problems, with commercially successful, production-ready features. We're proudly part of&nbsp; Visma , a European leader in cloud software. True Work-Life Balance and Flexibility Asynchronous-First: &nbsp;We prioritize focused work. Important decisions are documented in Gitlab, email, or Quip (our wiki) to minimize interruptions. We discourage unnecessary Slack mentions and encourage using the \"Do Not Disturb\" function. Flexible Schedule:&nbsp; It's okay to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day for personal appointments or errands. You fully decide when you take time off; if there aren’t enough people available, we’ll decrease the load instead of asking folks to move their holidays. Interested? You can apply today. There is no benefit to applying early, so take your time to consider the role and answer the application questions thoroughly. Apply for the job right here. Or email us with any questions:&nbsp; zoe.deswaef @silverfin.com We may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses.

If this appeals to you, continue reading for a longer text about working at Silverfin and your role &nbsp; At Silverfin, we're an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. Although we know we’re not perfect yet, we are working hard on it and always open for your feedback. &nbsp; According to our vision to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive organisation, our policy is to only make a final hiring decision if underrepresented groups are sufficiently represented in the list of candidates applying for the position. For this reason it’s possible interviews get slightly delayed until we’ve reached that goal. &nbsp; We're committed to elevating talent by creating an environment where we can all thrive together. So if you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily check every single box, please consider applying. We'd love to hear how you might contribute to our mission and our team. What can we offer you? Actual, proper work-life balance Flexible working hours and work 100% remotely Personal growth training and opportunities Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 40+ colleagues in 14 different countries on two continents A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues A €1200 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills Two engineering retreats per year, somewhere in Europe&nbsp; Ten company-wide Wellbeing Days per year for all employees (once a month, except in July and August) Compensation For this role, the compensation range is &nbsp;€104.000&nbsp;- €130.000&nbsp;a year , which reflects the total compensation band for senior engineers at this level. &nbsp; Please note: Most candidates start at the lower to mid part of the range, depending on experience and how their profile compares to our existing team. The higher end of the range is typically offered to individuals with a track record of strong impact and deep expertise in similar roles. We run annual compensation reviews, so there is clear opportunity for growth as you progress in the role. What will you work on? Figure out the best way to solve a customer or business problem in close collaboration with a product manager, a product designer and other engineers&nbsp; Work on user facing functionalities&nbsp; Help with discovery and delivery of a solution&nbsp; Give the engineering perspective on potential ways of approaching a specific challenge&nbsp; Help with maintenance and support of existing functionality What are we looking for? You’re experienced in both Ruby and Rails, and also understand where the boundaries lie between them. You can code in Ruby without any of Rails’ training wheels if necessary. You have experience using Javascript framework(s), understand the value of them, but also know when plain Javascript is enough. You're interested in getting to know our customers to find the best solution for a given challenge.&nbsp; You can communicate clearly in English, both in writing and verbally. You’re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognise bike-shedding and can avoid its pitfalls. You know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as good object oriented design. You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project. You’ve got opinions on code design and you can discuss them, but you’re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary. If you’re any good at Ruby, this is probably not the first job ad you’ve seen, so we’ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we’re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don’t hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions , or read on for the more detailed explanation .. &nbsp; What’s a Silverfin? At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners. &nbsp; The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every week more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 400.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in. &nbsp; Since November 2023 we are proudly part of Visma - the European leader in mission-critical cloud software, enjoying the power of the Visma brand and resources whilst retaining business autonomy and go-to-market freedom. &nbsp; What’s the product team like? The product team is a cross-functional team where engineers work together closely with product managers and product designers. The team's input is a user or business problem which it can solve with a high degree of autonomy. From day one all profiles are involved in understanding the problem, ideating solutions and doing quick experiments to prove that a certain solution might actually lead to the desired outcome. After the discovery phase the same team is tasked with the delivery of the chosen solution. The team will then track the adoption of the solution and will make sure that the problem is actually solved. The setup of the team is largely based on the book \"Inspired\" by Marty Cagan. &nbsp; What does working at Silverfin look like? Next to the four product teams, there are three more platformy teams, who own complex subsystems, like syncs or AI, and or support the product teams with knowledge, frameworks and services. &nbsp; Our ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise. We’re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the “other side”. &nbsp; We run an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend, with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Google Meet as our remote conferencing tool of choice.&nbsp; &nbsp; No code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they’re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement. &nbsp; Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 10TB*, and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own. &nbsp; *: Our ops team noted that this actually isn’t that hard to achieve if you’re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right? &nbsp; What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special? We’re a remote-first engineering team of 40 people distributed in 14 different countries over two continents. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be. &nbsp; Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids - whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself. &nbsp; You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organised that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday. &nbsp; Being remote-first means we favour asynchronous communication. We don’t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in Quip, so there’s a written, persisted record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working! &nbsp; We’d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments. &nbsp; What does your future look like? Personal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you don’t need to move to management in order to advance. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor just like as a manager. &nbsp; Everyone has a €1200 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation, travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you’ll get paid like any normal day. &nbsp; Requirements You have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby, or 2 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in one or more other programming languages You have experience Javascript framework(s) Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h) You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally Nice to haves These would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don’t worry if none of the following applies to you. Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team Experience working with large datasets and the problems they bring Experience with Vue.js Experience in Fintech Accounting knowledge &nbsp; Interested? You can apply today and we’ll start having interviews from 24/11/2025. There’s no benefit to applying early, so you can take your time answering the application questions. &nbsp; Read about what our interviewing process looks like &nbsp; &nbsp; We may use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to support parts of the hiring process, such as reviewing applications, analyzing resumes, or assessing responses. These tools assist our recruitment team but do not replace human judgment. Final hiring decisions are ultimately made by humans.

We’re eager to make a product our customers fall in love with over and over again. &nbsp; We 💛 small scaling businesses. Since 2013, we’ve been building a CRM that focuses on better communication, without the hassle of manual data entry or a complex UI. We are out to supercharge sales productivity with the most modern, thoughtfully designed, all-in-one, communication-focused CRM.&nbsp; &nbsp; Our backend tech stack consists primarily of Python Flask web apps with our TaskTiger scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like EKS, MSK, RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. We have CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to Kubernetes clusters. We also use these images in our local development environment allowing coding locally against all of our services. We have a well-documented public API that is consumed by our front-end JavaScript app as well as numerous integrations. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using Terraform, Ansible and other AWS tools. &nbsp; Our product development process is inspired by Shape Up . We love open sourcing our code and ideas on our GitHub and on The Making of Close , our behind-the-scenes Product &amp; Engineering blog.

    "description": "Headquarters: Worldwide! We&#39;re fully remote. URL: https://www.ynab.com/ About Us and Why We’re Hiring We’re YNAB (“why-nab”), a financial education company with a mission: to help people get good with money so they never have to worry about money again. For over 20 years, YNAB’s proven method has been changing lives—and people can’t stop telling their friends about the difference it’s made. Think: debt paid off, marriages strengthened, goals achieved, stress erased, and sleep finally restored. But don’t just take our word for it—dive into our vibrant communities on Facebook , TikTok , and Reddit (really!) or skim through our glowing app reviews . You’ll quickly see why people rave about YNAB and why we’re so passionate about creating something that truly changes lives for the better. Before we can help people get good with money, they need to trust YNAB with private details of their lives. And to those who work here, YNAB embodies years of relentless effort to craft something uniquely wonderful. Honoring that trust and protecting the company we’re proud of is why this position exists. Our security team is dedicated full-time to safeguarding YNAB, and they have a single primary outcome to achieve:&nbsp; Keep YNAB Secure. If the thought of anchoring our commitment to protecting YNAB and its customers resonates deeply, you’re our target audience—please read on. What We’re Looking For: Hard Requirements To be considered for this role, you must: Have at least two years of hands-on experience in security engineering, software engineering, DevOps, IT security, or a closely related technical field. Have practical experience with application security (for example: performing code reviews, threat modeling, working with developers on secure design, or using SAST/DAST tools). Have experience building, maintaining, or monitoring security logs—preferably with DataDog, but similar systems (Splunk, ELK, CloudWatch, etc.) are fine. Live in the United States, in either the Central (UTC-6) or Eastern (UTC-5) timezone, and be authorized to work here without sponsorship. Preferred Qualifications These aren’t required, but are likely to set you up for success: Some level of formal technical education and/or a security-related certification (such as CISSP, CEH, Security+, CC, CCSP, Pentest+, or similar).&nbsp; Proficiency in at least one modern programming or scripting language (e.g., Python, Go, Java, JavaScript). Familiarity with security frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST, or CIS Controls. Experience working at a technology and/or SaaS company. Exposure to regulated industries (e.g., finance, healthcare). Comfort working cross-functionally with engineering, support, or compliance teams. Note: If you believe you’re a fit for this role, but don’t meet our preferred qualifications, we still encourage you to apply. While our hard requirements are non-negotiable, we’re otherwise open-minded, and don’t need you to be the perfect candidate on paper.&nbsp; Life at YNAB That’s a quick snapshot of what we’re looking for. Before we go further, let’s make sure you’re excited about working with us. We’ll share more about YNAB, then dive into the role details and application process (be sure to read all the way to the end!). YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re established, profitable, and in this for the long haul. We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original Core Value Manifesto has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably like it here! We live our Core Values every day at YNAB, and we mean it when we say we are an equal opportunity employer. We believe a diversity of backgrounds, abilities, and experiences is critical to our success, and we are passionate about creating a welcoming and supportive environment for every employee. All are encouraged to apply as we continue growing a smart, hard-working, and diverse team that loves building something that matters. We also work really hard, together, to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We’re (humbly) proud to have received many of Fortune’s “Great Place to Work” awards over the years, including #1 two years in a row! We have a team of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be delighted to work with. Let’s introduce you to a few of them! Who You’ll Work With You'll work most closely with Kendal (our Security Lead), and Chris (our Systems Administrator), while collaborating with the wider Engineering department (which includes teams of QA analysts, full stack, iOS, and Android engineers).&nbsp; Kendal develops and implements our security roadmap, from technical security to governance, risk and compliance. She lived in London for six years before moving back home to South Africa in 2024. When she isn’t securing stuff, she’s spending time in Cape Town’s mountains and oceans.&nbsp; Chris is our systems administrator, which is a fancy title for a technology generalist. Day in and day out, Chris is helping to make sure everyone at YNAB has the tools to do their job, access to the systems needed to do their job, and a little bit of “we’re not sure who should be doing this”. Outside of YNAB, Chris is a middle grade author writing books for kids who’d rather not be reading. Regardless of their varied jobs, everyone in Engineering has one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s external competitors (or the occasional online game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to solve problems in creative ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier. Though you’ll be embedded in Engineering, you’ll probably cross paths with many people at YNAB at some point. We can’t list them all, but we can say that we are all excited to get to know you! How You’ll Work at YNAB Now that you’ve learned about some of your future teammates, let’s talk more about YNAB and what it’s like to work here. Building a Good Company At YNAB, we think one of the best things we can offer is the chance to do meaningful work alongside people you respect, admire, and genuinely enjoy. And we mean that—from the beginning, we’ve been intentional about creating the company we want to work for.&nbsp; Along the way, we’ve learned that great teams aren’t built on perks or fancy titles—they’re built by bringing together high performers who thrive on tough challenges and share a commitment to doing exceptional work. We value discipline and ownership over unnecessary layers of process, and look for people who wake up excited to get important things done.&nbsp; That’s the team we’re building at YNAB: one that cares deeply, works pragmatically, and always finds time to laugh (mostly at ourselves). Live (Almost) Anywhere You Want We’ve always been a fully remote team, and have people all over the world. For this particular position, however, we're looking for someone based in the United States, in either the Central (UTC-6) or Eastern (UTC-5) timezone. Anywhere within those time zones is okay, though. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection. (Like, a really good one. Please.) Work Four Days a Week We’ve adopted a four-day work week and rarely work more than that. There are occasions and seasons where things get busy and people put some extra time in—but then we encourage them to take some extra time off, too. We’re a product-led organization that takes our work-life balance seriously, so we all prioritize working hard and smart, but at a measured pace. We care deeply about what we do, but we also love our families and about 2,000 other things. We have perspective and, ultimately, we think it makes us—and our work—even better. Flex Your Work Schedule As a remote team, a lot of our work is done asynchronously. Outside of your meetings and on-call times, we trust you to set your schedule by balancing your team’s needs with your own needs. You don’t need to ask for permission to take off early for an afternoon appointment, or be “active” on Slack if you’re working deeply on a project. We look at what you accomplish, not how long you're in front of a computer. Take Vacation (Seriously) We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for our company-wide December Break). It’s important to get plenty of downtime and to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your adventures in our #office-wall Slack channel! Meet the Team IRL We love remote work around here, but we also love getting together in person. You’ll generally have the opportunity to meet with your YNAB teammates at least once a year, at a small-team work-focused meetup or at our biennial company retreat. At the YNAB retreat, we love to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. To give you an idea, we’ve been to Costa Rica , a gigantic cabin in the mountains, a ranch in Montana, Palm Springs , and most recently, Cape Cod. We work together, play together, and strengthen the bonds we’ve made as a team and company. At the end of each retreat, we feel energized, inspired, and excited to tackle the work ahead. Up Your Game We’re serious about helping you improve your craft, and will provide you with a professional development stipend each year. Think conferences, online courses, coaching, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new. We love to see our people grow! Other Benefits Our team is spread all over the world—mostly in the United States, but also in the UK, Canada, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, and several other countries. Everyone is eligible for our generous paid family leave, vacation, holidays, and sick time.&nbsp; Since you’re based in the United States, you’ll also be eligible for our health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. No need to check your vision, you read that right—100%. (Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)&nbsp; We also have a Traditional and Roth 401(k) option, where YNAB matches your contributions up to six percent with immediate vesting. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. Not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.)&nbsp; Competitive Compensation At YNAB, we are dedicated to providing equitable, market-driven, and data-informed compensation, along with a competitive benefits package. The starting salary for this role will range from $120,000 - $140,000 USD annually. (This covers a wide range of possible experience; think of it like a bell curve. Most candidates fall somewhere around the midpoint.) You'll also be eligible for an annual raise and profit-sharing twice a year. When YNAB succeeds, so do you—that’s the idea. A Few Final Tidbits Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)&nbsp; We love to celebrate with you when you complete something on your bucket list—AND, we love using your bucket list as inspiration for your birthday present! We want you firing on all cylinders, so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did we mention that YNAB makes a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not think that matters much, but then a few months down the road, you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this! If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you, and how you’ll play a big part in changing people’s lives. Now back to you, our new Security Engineer… In this hands-on, highly technical role, you’ll join forces with Kendal to make YNAB Even More Secure™. (Okay, it’s not a trademark, but we felt like it deserved capitalization because we are just that grateful for you two.) While Kendal is focused on higher-level compliance and risk management, you’ll be focused on technical security implementation and security architecture support. In true team fashion, you’ll both share responsibility for incident response and monitoring (this is where your timezone comes in handy; you’ll be available when Kendal is not, and vice versa). To say a bit more about each of those: Technical Security Implementation You’ll be hands-on with implementing security controls and processes. On a day-to-day basis, you’ll: Configure and maintain security tooling across the organization, including monitoring systems, vulnerability management platforms, and automated security processes. Implement and optimize access controls, authentication systems, and data protection measures. Write automation scripts, analyze security logs, and help maintain our security infrastructure. Help maintain security standards, guidelines, and best practices. Security Architecture Support You’ll work with our Engineering team to design and implement secure systems and help ensure security is built into our products from the ground up. To do so, you’ll: Collaborate with engineers to integrate security into the development lifecycle through activities like secure code reviews, threat modeling, and design consultations. Conduct security testing of new features and systems, including vulnerability assessments and security reviews. Perform security assessments to proactively identify potential issues, in line with security by design principles. Incident Response and Monitoring You’ll help monitor our security landscape, investigate potential threats, assist with incident response, and contribute to our continuous improvement of security practices. Alongside Kendal, you’ll: Monitor security events, analyze threats, and respond to security incidents with appropriate containment and remediation actions. Support bug bounty program activities and coordinate responses to external security reports. Research emerging threats and maintain awareness of security trends relevant to our technology stack. You’re the person we’re looking for if: You’re passionate about building secure systems and protecting our users. You’re excited to dig into the technical details. You thrive on solving complex technical problems and aren’t afraid to learn new technologies. You balance thoroughness with pragmatism—you know when to dig deeper and when to move forward with the information you have.&nbsp; You communicate well with both technical and non-technical teammates, and enjoy collaborating across different teams. You pride yourself on being approachable and easy to work with. You enjoy thinking outside of the box when it comes to security and compliance. Rather than blocking progress, you consider all choices before making a decision, adapt when you receive new information, and know the right solution is the one that works best for YNAB. You’re eager to dive deep into meaningful security challenges, while growing your expertise. In summary: If you’re technically skilled, security-focused, and excited to help keep YNAB safe… we hope you’ll apply! How to Apply Submit your application here (including what’s listed below) by Sunday, January 25th at 11:59pm PT. Firm. It’s a real deadline. What to include in your application: A resume. If you don’t have an updated formal resume, that’s fine! An informal overview of your work history and education is all we’re looking for. A cover letter and answers to a few specific questions. This isn’t your typical cover letter—skip the fluff and formalities, and just help us get to know you.&nbsp; On page 1: We’d love for you to tell us a bit about yourself, what drew you to work in security, why you’re interested in this role at YNAB, and why you think you’d be a great fit.&nbsp; On page 2 onward: Please answer these questions three: 1. Tell us about a time when you were convinced you were right about something at work, but later changed your mind. What swayed you? Please answer in 1-2 paragraphs. 2. How have you honed your craft in security engineering, and how do you see yourself continuing to develop your skills in the future? Feel free to share specific strategies, sources of information or inspiration, and/or your general approach. Please answer in 1-2 paragraphs. 3. Imagine you’re our Security Engineer. You’ve just discovered a potentially critical vulnerability in a third-party dependency used in our codebase. Now it’s your job to validate the vulnerability and raise it to the engineering team responsible for remediation. Please craft a 1-2 paragraph vulnerability report as though you’re writing directly to them. (Feel free to make assumptions about this scenario to guide your response.) Tips: Please be yourself! ChatGPT can sit this one out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you meet our hard requirements and follow the application instructions, we promise a real human will review your materials.&nbsp; Though we know it’s customary in some areas, please do not share a headshot anywhere in your application materials. You’ll only be able to apply once, so make sure your answers are final before you click submit. (You can start your application and come back to it later.)&nbsp; Keep an eye out for an email from @pinpoint.email titled Thank you for applying to YNAB! This confirms your application has been received. If you don’t receive it, please apply again.&nbsp; If we can help with an accessibility need, email us at accommodations@ynab.com and indicate in the subject line that you’re applying for the Security Engineer role. (Please note that we can only respond to messages related to accommodations at this email.) Finally, please click here for an outline of what this hiring process will look like. It’s rigorous, but truthfully, people say it’s fun! We look forward to hearing from you!&nbsp; P.S. If you’re not interested in this position right now, but know someone who might be, we’d appreciate you passing this along!

But don’t just take our word for it—dive into our vibrant communities on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ynabofficial/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@ynabofficial\">TikTok</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/\">Reddit</a> (really!) or skim through our glowing <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ynab-budgeting-finance/id1010865877\">app</a> <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.youneedabudget.evergreen.app&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1\">reviews</a>. You’ll quickly see why people rave about YNAB and why we’re so passionate about creating something that truly changes lives for the better.</p>\n<p>Before we can help people get good with money, they need to trust YNAB with private details of their lives. And to those who work here, YNAB embodies years of relentless effort to craft something uniquely wonderful. Honoring that trust and protecting the company we’re proud of is why this position exists. Our security team is dedicated full-time to safeguarding YNAB, and they have a single primary outcome to achieve:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Keep YNAB Secure.</p>\n<p>If the thought of anchoring our commitment to protecting YNAB and its customers resonates deeply, you’re our target audience—please read on.</p>\n<h2>What We’re Looking For:</h2>\n<h3>Hard Requirements</h3>\n<p>To be considered for this role, you must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Have at least two years of hands-on experience in security engineering, software engineering, DevOps, IT security, or a closely related technical field.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have practical experience with application security (for example: performing code reviews, threat modeling, working with developers on secure design, or using SAST/DAST tools).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have experience building, maintaining, or monitoring security logs—preferably with DataDog, but similar systems (Splunk, ELK, CloudWatch, etc.) are fine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Live in the United States, in either the Central (UTC-6) or Eastern (UTC-5) timezone, and be authorized to work here without sponsorship.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Preferred Qualifications</h3>\n<p>These aren’t required, but are likely to set you up for success:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Some level of formal technical education and/or a security-related certification (such as CISSP, CEH, Security+, CC, CCSP, Pentest+, or similar).&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Proficiency in at least one modern programming or scripting language (e.g., Python, Go, Java, JavaScript).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Familiarity with security frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST, or CIS Controls.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experience working at a technology and/or SaaS company.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Exposure to regulated industries (e.g., finance, healthcare).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Comfort working cross-functionally with engineering, support, or compliance teams.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: If you believe you’re a fit for this role, but don’t meet our preferred qualifications, we still encourage you to apply. While our hard requirements are non-negotiable, we’re otherwise open-minded, and don’t need you to be the perfect candidate on paper.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Life at YNAB</h2>\n<p>That’s a quick snapshot of what we’re looking for. Before we go further, let’s make sure you’re excited about working with us. We’ll share more about YNAB, then dive into the role details and application process (be sure to read all the way to the end!).</p>\n<p>YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re established, profitable, and in this for the long haul. We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original <a href=\"https://www.ynab.com/about-us/core-value-manifesto\">Core Value Manifesto</a> has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably like it here!</p>\n<p>We live our Core Values every day at YNAB, and we mean it when we say we are an equal opportunity employer. We believe a diversity of backgrounds, abilities, and experiences is critical to our success, and we are passionate about creating a welcoming and supportive environment for every employee. All are encouraged to apply as we continue growing a smart, hard-working, and diverse team that loves building something that matters.</p>\n<p>We also work really hard, together, to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We’re (humbly) proud to have received <a href=\"https://www.greatplacetowork.com/certified-company/1367344\">many of Fortune’s “Great Place to Work” awards</a> over the years, including #1 two years in a row! We have a team of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be delighted to work with. Let’s introduce you to a few of them!</p>\n<h2>Who You’ll Work With</h2>\n<p>You'll work most closely with Kendal (our Security Lead), and Chris (our Systems Administrator), while collaborating with the wider Engineering department (which includes teams of QA analysts, full stack, iOS, and Android engineers).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Kendal develops and implements our security roadmap, from technical security to governance, risk and compliance. She lived in London for six years before moving back home to South Africa in 2024. When she isn’t securing stuff, she’s spending time in Cape Town’s mountains and oceans.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chris is our systems administrator, which is a fancy title for a technology generalist. Day in and day out, Chris is helping to make sure everyone at YNAB has the tools to do their job, access to the systems needed to do their job, and a little bit of “we’re not sure who should be doing this”. Outside of YNAB, Chris is a middle grade author writing books for kids who’d rather not be reading.</p>\n<p>Regardless of their varied jobs, everyone in Engineering has one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s external competitors (or the occasional online game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to solve problems in creative ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</p>\n<p>Though you’ll be embedded in Engineering, you’ll probably cross paths with many people at YNAB at some point. We can’t list them all, but we can say that we are all excited to get to know you!</p>\n<h1>How You’ll Work at YNAB</h1>\n<p>Now that you’ve learned about some of your future teammates, let’s talk more about YNAB and what it’s like to work here.</p>\n<h2>Building a Good Company</h2>\n<p>At YNAB, we think one of the best things we can offer is the chance to do meaningful work alongside people you respect, admire, and genuinely enjoy. And we mean that—from the beginning, we’ve been intentional about creating the company we want to work for.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Along the way, we’ve learned that great teams aren’t built on perks or fancy titles—they’re built by bringing together high performers who thrive on tough challenges and share a commitment to doing exceptional work. We value discipline and ownership over unnecessary layers of process, and look for people who wake up excited to get important things done.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That’s the team we’re building at YNAB: one that cares deeply, works pragmatically, and always finds time to laugh (mostly at ourselves).</p>\n<h2>Live (Almost) Anywhere You Want</h2>\n<p>We’ve always been a fully remote team, and have people all over the world. For this particular position, however, we're looking for someone based in the United States, in either the Central (UTC-6) or Eastern (UTC-5) timezone. Anywhere within those time zones is okay, though. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection. (Like, a really good one. Please.)</p>\n<h2>Work Four Days a Week</h2>\n<p>We’ve adopted a four-day work week and rarely work more than that. There are occasions and seasons where things get busy and people put some extra time in—but then we encourage them to take some extra time off, too. We’re a product-led organization that takes our work-life balance seriously, so we all prioritize working hard and smart, but at a measured pace. We care deeply about what we do, but we also love our families and about 2,000 other things. We have perspective and, ultimately, we think it makes us—and our work—even better.</p>\n<h2>Flex Your Work Schedule</h2>\n<p>As a remote team, a lot of our work is done asynchronously. Outside of your meetings and on-call times, we trust you to set your schedule by balancing your team’s needs with your own needs. You don’t need to ask for permission to take off early for an afternoon appointment, or be “active” on Slack if you’re working deeply on a project. We look at what you accomplish, not how long you're in front of a computer.</p>\n<h2>Take Vacation (Seriously)</h2>\n<p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for our company-wide December Break). It’s important to get plenty of downtime and to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your adventures in our #office-wall Slack channel!</p>\n<h2>Meet the Team IRL</h2>\n<p>We love remote work around here, but we also love getting together in person. You’ll generally have the opportunity to meet with your YNAB teammates at least once a year, at a small-team work-focused meetup or at our biennial company retreat. At the YNAB retreat, we love to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. To give you an idea, we’ve been to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fs1TN-jrDI\">Costa Rica</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/\">gigantic cabin</a> in the mountains, a ranch in Montana, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/pVxX0SZ9OFs\">Palm Springs</a>, and most recently, Cape Cod. We work together, play together, and strengthen the bonds we’ve made as a team and company. At the end of each retreat, we feel energized, inspired, and excited to tackle the work ahead.</p>\n<h2>Up Your Game</h2>\n<p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft, and will provide you with a professional development stipend each year. Think conferences, online courses, coaching, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new. We love to see our people grow!</p>\n<h2>Other Benefits</h2>\n<p>Our team is spread all over the world—mostly in the United States, but also in the UK, Canada, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, and several other countries. Everyone is eligible for our generous paid family leave, vacation, holidays, and sick time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since you’re based in the United States, you’ll also be eligible for our health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. No need to check your vision, you read that right—100%. (Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401(k) option, where YNAB matches your contributions up to six percent with immediate vesting. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. Not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.)&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Competitive Compensation</h2>\n<p>At YNAB, we are dedicated to providing equitable, market-driven, and data-informed compensation, along with a competitive benefits package. The starting salary for this role will range from $120,000 - $140,000 USD annually. (This covers a wide range of possible experience; think of it like a bell curve. Most candidates fall somewhere around the midpoint.) You'll also be eligible for an annual raise and profit-sharing twice a year. When YNAB succeeds, so do you—that’s the idea.</p>\n<h2>A Few Final Tidbits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We love to celebrate with you when you complete something on your bucket list—AND, we love using your bucket list as inspiration for your birthday present!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We want you firing on all cylinders, so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Did we mention that YNAB makes a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not think that matters much, but then a few months down the road, you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you, and how you’ll play a big part in changing people’s lives.</p>\n<h1>Now back to you, our new Security Engineer…</h1>\n<p>In this hands-on, highly technical role, you’ll join forces with Kendal to make YNAB Even More Secure™. (Okay, it’s not a trademark, but we felt like it deserved capitalization because we are just that grateful for you two.)</p>\n<p>While Kendal is focused on higher-level compliance and risk management, you’ll be focused on technical security implementation and security architecture support. In true team fashion, you’ll both share responsibility for incident response and monitoring (this is where your timezone comes in handy; you’ll be available when Kendal is not, and vice versa).</p>\n<p>To say a bit more about each of those:</p>\n<h3>Technical Security Implementation</h3>\n<p>You’ll be hands-on with implementing security controls and processes. On a day-to-day basis, you’ll:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Configure and maintain security tooling across the organization, including monitoring systems, vulnerability management platforms, and automated security processes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Implement and optimize access controls, authentication systems, and data protection measures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Write automation scripts, analyze security logs, and help maintain our security infrastructure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Help maintain security standards, guidelines, and best practices.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Security Architecture Support</h3>\n<p>You’ll work with our Engineering team to design and implement secure systems and help ensure security is built into our products from the ground up. To do so, you’ll:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Collaborate with engineers to integrate security into the development lifecycle through activities like secure code reviews, threat modeling, and design consultations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Conduct security testing of new features and systems, including vulnerability assessments and security reviews.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Perform security assessments to proactively identify potential issues, in line with security by design principles.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Incident Response and Monitoring</h3>\n<p>You’ll help monitor our security landscape, investigate potential threats, assist with incident response, and contribute to our continuous improvement of security practices. Alongside Kendal, you’ll:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Monitor security events, analyze threats, and respond to security incidents with appropriate containment and remediation actions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Support bug bounty program activities and coordinate responses to external security reports.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Research emerging threats and maintain awareness of security trends relevant to our technology stack.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>You’re the person we’re looking for if:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You’re passionate about building secure systems and protecting our users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You’re excited to dig into the technical details. You thrive on solving complex technical problems and aren’t afraid to learn new technologies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You balance thoroughness with pragmatism—you know when to dig deeper and when to move forward with the information you have.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You communicate well with both technical and non-technical teammates, and enjoy collaborating across different teams. You pride yourself on being approachable and easy to work with.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You enjoy thinking outside of the box when it comes to security and compliance. Rather than blocking progress, you consider all choices before making a decision, adapt when you receive new information, and know the right solution is the one that works best for YNAB.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You’re eager to dive deep into meaningful security challenges, while growing your expertise.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary: If you’re technically skilled, security-focused, and excited to help keep YNAB safe… we hope you’ll apply!</p>\n<h1>How to Apply</h1>\n<p>Submit your application <a href=\"https://ynab.pinpointhq.com/postings/54727c91-6605-4e8a-b91b-e56798d78288?utm_medium=paid_job_board&amp;utm_source=We+Work+Remotely\">here</a> (including what’s listed below) by Sunday, January 25th at 11:59pm PT. Firm. It’s a real deadline.</p>\n<h2>What to include in your application:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A resume. If you don’t have an updated formal resume, that’s fine! An informal overview of your work history and education is all we’re looking for.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A cover letter and answers to a few specific questions. This isn’t your typical cover letter—skip the fluff and formalities, and just help us get to know you.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>On page 1: We’d love for you to tell us a bit about yourself, what drew you to work in security, why you’re interested in this role at YNAB, and why you think you’d be a great fit.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On page 2 onward: Please answer these questions three:</p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>1. Tell us about a time when you were convinced you were right about something at work, but later changed your mind. What swayed you? Please answer in 1-2 paragraphs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>2. How have you honed your craft in security engineering, and how do you see yourself continuing to develop your skills in the future? Feel free to share specific strategies, sources of information or inspiration, and/or your general approach. Please answer in 1-2 paragraphs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>3. Imagine you’re our Security Engineer. You’ve just discovered a potentially critical vulnerability in a third-party dependency used in our codebase. Now it’s your job to validate the vulnerability and raise it to the engineering team responsible for remediation. Please craft a 1-2 paragraph vulnerability report as though you’re writing directly to them. (Feel free to make assumptions about this scenario to guide your response.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tips:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Please be yourself! ChatGPT can sit this one out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you meet our hard requirements and follow the application instructions, we promise a real human will review your materials.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Though we know it’s customary in some areas, please do not share a headshot anywhere in your application materials.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You’ll only be able to apply once, so make sure your answers are final before you click submit. (You can start your application and come back to it later.)&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Keep an eye out for an email from @pinpoint.email titled Thank you for applying to YNAB! This confirms your application has been received. If you don’t receive it, please apply again.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If we can help with an accessibility need, email us at accommodations@ynab.com and indicate in the subject line that you’re applying for the Security Engineer role. (Please note that we can only respond to messages related to accommodations at this email.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, please <a href=\"https://ynab.pinpointhq.com/jobs/449056/hiring-process?token=UxKXvMeyKpnZURwMijxkRKJM\">click here</a> for an outline of what this hiring process will look like.

This is a unique opportunity to join as one of the early engineering team members of a well-funded startup building at the intersection of generative AI and cybersecurity. You'll design, code, and maintain sophisticated infrastructure spanning 12-15 AWS accounts, each with dedicated Kubernetes clusters, ensuring complete data segregation for our security-conscious enterprise customers. You'll take full ownership of our infrastructure-as-code implementation, managing multiple Kubernetes clusters at scale using cutting-edge tools like Karpenter, Flux, and Kustomize. Your success will be measured by infrastructure reliability, deployment velocity, and your ability to build self-managed, distributed systems that scale elegantly as we grow from startup to enterprise scale. This role is perfect for a hands-on infrastructure engineer who has mastered complex Kubernetes deployments at scale, writes production-grade infrastructure code, and thrives on building simple, elegant solutions to complex distributed systems challenges. Your Contributions to Our Journey: Architect Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Infrastructure: Design, implement, and write infrastructure-as-code for our complex Kubernetes setup spanning multiple AWS accounts, ensuring each cluster is completely isolated for enterprise security requirements while maintaining operational efficiency Build Self-Managed, Distributed Systems: Develop infrastructure that manages itself through GitOps workflows using Flux and Kustomize, creating distributed systems where actions in one place automatically trigger appropriate changes across the infrastructure without manual intervention Scale Kubernetes Operations: Manage and optimize dozens of Kubernetes clusters across our multi-tenant and single-tenant environments, implementing auto-scaling solutions with Karpenter and ensuring seamless scaling as customer workloads grow exponentially Develop Production-Grade Automation: Write robust, maintainable code to build and maintain CI/CD pipelines, custom automation tools, and deployment scripts that enable rapid feature delivery while maintaining the highest reliability standards Ensure Enterprise Security: Implement security best practices and compliance measures that protect our highly sensitive security data, managing firewalls, encryption, IAM policies, and network segregation across our multi-account AWS architecture Optimize Platform Performance: Build comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting systems that proactively identify issues, using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to ensure our infrastructure scales efficiently as we handle increasingly complex workloads Enable Engineering Velocity: Work closely with backend and data engineering teams to build self-service infrastructure capabilities, allowing teams to provision databases, deploy services, and scale resources independently without constant infrastructure team involvement What You Need to Be Successful: Kubernetes Mastery at Scale: 5+ years of infrastructure/DevOps experience with deep, hands-on expertise managing complex Kubernetes deployments—you must have experience with multiple Kubernetes clusters (tens of clusters) in sophisticated setups, not just simple single-cluster environments GitOps and Modern K8s Tooling: Proven production experience with Karpenter (for auto-scaling), Flux (for GitOps), and Kustomize (for configuration management)—if you have these three, you'll be a fish in the water with our infrastructure approach AWS Infrastructure Expertise: Deep knowledge of AWS with hands-on experience managing complex multi-account architectures, understanding how to design for isolation, security, and scalability across numerous AWS accounts with proper networking and IAM configuration Infrastructure-as-Code Excellence: Strong coding skills with production experience using Terraform or CloudFormation, writing maintainable, well-architected infrastructure code that follows best practices and scales with organizational growth. Proficiency in Python is essential for automation, tooling, and infrastructure development Hands-On Coding: Currently active as a developer writing production code in Python for infrastructure automation, custom tooling, and operational scripts—you're not just an architect who delegates implementation Simplicity-Driven Architecture: Proven ability to build simple, elegant solutions to complex infrastructure problems—you instinctively know the \"right way\" to use tools like Helm charts and avoid over-engineering while maintaining scalability Platform Thinking: Experience building infrastructure with a platform mindset, creating systems that support multiple products and enable team self-service rather than building one-off solutions for individual applications AWS Managed Services Philosophy: Understanding of when to use AWS managed services (RDS, MSK, EMR) versus building custom solutions, with experience scaling startups using managed services efficiently before investing in complex self-hosted infrastructure Distributed Systems Mindset: Deep understanding of distributed systems principles with experience building infrastructure that is decentralized rather than centralized, allowing independent operation across multiple clusters and regions Nice to haves: Experience with AWS auto-scaling across complex, multi-cluster environments Background in security-focused infrastructure or handling sensitive enterprise data Previous experience at scale-ups that grew infrastructure from 20-100+ engineers Knowledge of infrastructure observability tools beyond Prometheus/Grafana (e.g., ELK Stack) Track record of building infrastructure that went through SOC2, ISO, or similar compliance certifications Why Join Us: Ambitious Infrastructure Challenges: We're using generative AI (LLMs and agents) to solve critical cybersecurity challenges, requiring sophisticated infrastructure that handles sensitive security data across isolated enterprise environments. You'll build the foundation for breakthrough AI-powered security solutions at unprecedented scale. Expert Team: We are a team of hands-on leaders with deep experience in Big Tech and Scale-ups. Our team has been part of the leadership teams behind multiple acquisitions and an IPO. Impactful Work: Cybersecurity is a force for good—helping stop cyber attacks ultimately helps deliver better outcomes for all of us. The infrastructure you build will directly enable security teams to protect organizations worldwide from real threats. Build an AI-Native Company: We're building a new company in the AI era with the opportunity to design everything from the ground up—you'll architect infrastructure using cutting-edge Kubernetes practices and establish platform standards that will scale with us from startup through hypergrowth. Technical Leadership Growth: Direct partnership with experienced engineering leadership, significant equity upside, and the opportunity to own and shape the entire infrastructure function as we scale our platform to support the world's largest enterprises.
