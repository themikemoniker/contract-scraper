This role is for a full redesign of our website — not client work, not multiple sites. You’ll turn our Figma design into a custom WordPress site — no page builders, just a thoughtful, performant, hand-coded theme. We'll launch the new design component-by-component to the live site, so you’ll work closely with our team to build and ship each part with care. We use GitHub for version control. You should be confident in CSS, Tailwind CSS , PHP, JavaScript, and HTML. If you have an eye for detail and care about helping people through your work, we’d love to meet you.

Our current project is a major redesign , which still has a lot of logic to code. After that, you could be working on any number of projects, from interactive tools built from scratch (ex: an Operating Agreement generator) to internal tools for the content team.&nbsp; As a first step, you’ll get a full walkthrough of what’s been built so far. You might review or audit the code, and you’ll be part of the brainstorming and problem-solving process. You’ll also help us figure out exactly what work still needs to be done. Key Responsibilities: Turn detailed Figma designs into a responsive, accessible, and fully functional WordPress site Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code using CSS, PHP, JavaScript and HTML. Make sure everything works across browsers and runs fast Work closely with our designer, back-end developer, founder, and SEO strategist to get every detail right — we care deeply about doing great work Help improve how we build things by refining our process and sharing ideas Required Skills &amp; Qualifications: 10+ years of front-end WordPress experience Expert at turning Figma designs into custom WordPress themes Strong in CSS, PHP, JavaScript and HTML.

EBG's expanded network reaches over 100 million users from participating companies and closed loop affinity and membership groups.&nbsp; EBG owns and operates one of the largest and most comprehensive employee savings programs in the country — serving over 40,000 corporate clients through its proprietary platforms TicketsatWork, Plum Benefits, Working Advantage and Beneplace.&nbsp; EBG is a b2b2c company headquartered in Miami (Aventura), with offices in New York, Orlando, and Austin. We offer a hybrid work environment with a balance of collaboration and flexibility. Job Description In this role you will embark on a large-scale, multi-year modernization initiative to transform a legacy monolithic PHP application into a modern, microservice-oriented architecture hosted on AWS. Your role as a Web Developer will bring deep experience in API-driven development, AWS cloud infrastructure, and modern DevOps practices to help drive this transformation. You’ll play a key role in decoupling business domains, architecting, implementing, and maintaining new microservices using Symfony/Doctrine or similar frameworks. Your focus will be on delivering high-quality, secure, and scalable API integrations. Ideally, you bring hands-on experience across the full development lifecycle — from design and implementation to CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code — all within an Agile Scrum environment. This role is primarily WFH / Remote for Florida and Texas candidates but requires flexibility to attend any in office team meetings as needed.&nbsp; **You must reside in FL or TX**&nbsp; to be hired for this position. Key Responsibilities Have strong presence in the decoupling of the existing PHP monolith into domain-driven microservices and APIs. Design, develop, and maintain back-end services using Symfony (or equivalent MVC frameworks) and Doctrine ORM. Architect and implement RESTful APIs and ensure consistent documentation, testing, and versioning practices. Build and consume third-party APIs, ensuring performance, scalability, and security best practices. Collaborate closely with DevOps and Infrastructure teams to design cloud-native solutions using AWS services (e.g., Lambda, ECS, EKS, S3, API Gateway). Containerize applications using Docker and manage orchestration via Kubernetes/ECS. Implement and maintain CI/CD pipelines to support rapid, reliable deployments. Leverage infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools to ensure reproducible and maintainable environments. Contribute to architectural design discussions, code reviews, and cross-functional planning. Work within an Agile Scrum framework, participating in sprint grooming, planning, demo, and retrospectives. Collaborate with Product, QA, and Analytics teams to ensure feature alignment and data integrity. Qualifications &nbsp; 3+ years of professional experience in back-end development with PHP (Symfony preferred). Strong understanding of microservice architecture and API-first design principles. Proven experience deploying and managing applications on AWS (ECS, EKS, Lambda, API Gateway, RDS, CloudWatch, etc.). Proficiency with Docker and Kubernetes (EKS or equivalent) for containerized deployments. Hands-on experience with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, or AWS CodePipeline). Experience using Infrastructure-as-Code tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation. Strong understanding of third-party API integration patterns, rate limiting, and error handling best practices. Experience working within an Agile/Scrum environment. Solid understanding of software design patterns, version control (Git), and code quality best practices. Excellent problem-solving, communication, and collaboration skills. YOU MUST RESIDE IN FL or TX *EBG does not offer sponsorship for this role. What Sets You Apart: AWS Certification (Developer Associate or Solutions Architect). Experience with Doctrine ORM, Symfony 6, or similar frameworks. Knowledge of serverless architecture patterns using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Familiarity with event-driven architecture, message queues (e.g., SNS/SQS, Kafka), or data streaming. Background in travel, hospitality, or entertainment industries, especially with booking, ticketing, or reservation systems. Exposure to observability tools with focus on New Relic (other examples include CloudWatch, Datadog, or ELK stack). Understanding of security best practices for cloud-based microservices (IAM, least privilege, encryption). Experience mentoring developers or leading small Agile teams.

Think&nbsp; npm install &nbsp;for mechanical engineers - we're building the infrastructure that makes hardware development as fast as software. How we actually work We’re a small remote team made up of the best of the best. Our team members are distributed around the globe. While most of our product and engineering talent is located in Europe and Israel, you’ll also work with people from the US and Asia. Most of our work is made async, which is the secret sauce of our success. High trust, low bullshit: &nbsp;We don't count hours or peek over your shoulder on Slack. We trust you to get your work done and tell us when something's wrong. You'll have real ownership over what you build: which means you'll make a lot of decisions about architecture and functionality without endless approval cycles. (If that sounds terrifying, we're probably not a good fit. If that sounds exciting, keep reading.) Question everything: &nbsp;See something that doesn't make sense? Say it. Have a better way to do something? Just do it. We actually mean it when we say we want people to challenge the status quo and improve things. Our internal motto is “Don’t drink the kool-aid” No stupid Meetings: &nbsp;One weekly all-hands. One dev team sync. That's literally it. Everything else happens async in Slack or Loom. Your calendar will be beautifully, gloriously empty. Actually friendly, not corporate friendly: &nbsp;We play games online every week (current favorite: Make it Meme). Once a year we fly everyone somewhere beautiful for our offsite (Greece, here we come). We genuinely like hanging out together, which turns out to be way better than forced \"team building exercises.\" What we value in engineering: Simple &gt; Complicated. &nbsp;Simple code, simple architecture; Simple solutions are better than complex ones. Ship it, then improve it. &nbsp;Perfection is the enemy of done. Launch now, iterate forever. Product &gt; Engineering. &nbsp;Every line of code should make our users' lives better. We're not here to show off our algorithmic prowess - we're here to solve real business problems. Financials Jiga is fully funded, cashflow positive, with growing revenue MoM. We're completely transparent about our runway and finances - ask us anything. You'll love it here if You want to actually own things. &nbsp;Not \"ownership\" where you need three approvals to change a button color. Real ownership where you decide what to build, how to build it, and when to ship it. You're genuinely full-stack &nbsp;- you're equally happy building a slick UI component or optimizing a database query. There's no task you'd refuse because it's \"not your specialty.\" You care about the product, not just the code . You want to understand&nbsp; why &nbsp;we're building something and you'll push back if it doesn't make sense. You are motivated to run a marathon &nbsp;and ring the bell with us in 3-4 years from now. Bureaucracy makes you want to scream . Multiple approval layers, process for the sake of process, corporate theatre - if these sound like your nightmare, welcome home. You love shipping. &nbsp;Like, you get genuinely excited when you push to production. That \"it's alive!\" feeling never gets old. You work fast &nbsp;because you're having fun, not because someone's watching you. This might not be for you if You hate ambiguity. You prefer clear, detailed task assignments and well-defined requirements You like having management to check in, review and verify your work multiple times until it’s perfect You're looking for a cuddly, 9-5, corporate job where you can coast a bit You like the smell of gasoline and motor oil while driving to the office every day (sorry, we are 100% remote) You like weeks of architecting over-complicated solutions (No judgment if that's what you want - it's just not what we are.) What you need 3+ years building full-stack web applications end-to-end Strong at React + Node.js. MongoDB experience is a great plus. Experience building complex applications - you understand clean architecture, security, scaling, performance, and maintainability Solid data modeling fundamentals Product company experience (you've felt the joy and pain of real users) Some overlap with GMT+3 working hours so we can actually talk to you sometimes What we offer No ping pong tables. No beer kegs. No \"unlimited vacation\" that nobody takes. No ice cream fridge at the office. Oh right, we don't even have an office. Here's what we do have: A small team where you matter &nbsp;- we never compromise on people, that means you are part of the best team in the world. Zero bureaucracy &nbsp;- we hate process theatre as much as you do Real ownership and responsibility &nbsp;- make decisions, ship code, own the outcomes. Have real impact on the product from day 1. Complete flexibility &nbsp;- work from anywhere, set your own hours, take time off when you need it (parents and DMs are very welcome) Genuinely high trust &nbsp;- we trust you to do great work and be honest when things go sideways A team that actually likes each other &nbsp;- international, diverse, genuinely friendly people who enjoy working together Generous stock options &nbsp;- we’re looking for partners to run a marathon with us, you will get a life-changing shares when we get to the finish line Competitive salary and PTOs &nbsp;- so you can also enjoy, relax and recharge Self-development budget &nbsp;for books, courses, conferences, whatever helps you grow Annual offsite &nbsp;in beautiful places (greece, here we come!)

We're a bootstrapped company so there's no VCs to answer to.&nbsp; That doesn't mean we're not ambitious though - there's a massive market we're going after and we want to create lasting change.&nbsp; As a combination of these two things we've a heavy focus on getting stuff done. Our development ethos could be best described as \"full DHH\". Whilst there's some bits we don't 100% agree with we stick to the core Rails ethos and stack, focussing on what we can achieve with the technology, rather than the technology itself.&nbsp; If you've enjoyed some of the blog posts on how Basecamp structure code, or enjoy the work of boringrails.com, you'd like working with us. We're a small (but mighty) tech team of 4 so you'll be jumping straight in and writing code for customers from day 1. There's also infrastructure/UI work/mobile app development work that happens and you can become involved in if you so wish.&nbsp; The role has the opportunity to build into a CTO role for the right person. A little more about the role and us: It's really refreshing using technology to do something that helps people in a real world tangible way.&nbsp; Changing lives and increasing health through technology is very motivating! We love simplicity.&nbsp; We're fanatical about it.&nbsp; This goes from our codebase, to our infrastructure, to how we operate as a company.&nbsp; It can be harder work upfront but it sure makes life easier down the road. You'll need strong ownership skills.&nbsp; As a small team we don't have project managers.&nbsp; You're responsible for your tasks so you'll need to be good at taking ownership and reporting back to the team. An ability to renegotiate requirements as you get into the technical details is most welcome!&nbsp; In Computer Science there's hard problems and hard problems that don't need solving.&nbsp; We are constantly asking ourselves if there's an easier way to do something. We spend a lot of time talking to our customers and understanding their problems.&nbsp; This won't ever change.&nbsp; Be prepared to go back and evaluate previously held assumptions on new features after testing with beta customers The position is fulltime and by no means do you need to be into health/fitness to work here (only about 50% of our staff are).&nbsp; It's fully remote position but you'd need to be on an EU timezone so there's sufficient overlap with the rest of the team.&nbsp; We also do a full team meetup in person twice per year.

    "description": "Headquarters: Remote (Europe) URL: http://mazehq.com Summary of the Role: As Infra/DevOps Engineer at Maze, you'll be the architect of our complex, multi-account Kubernetes infrastructure, building and scaling the foundation that powers our AI-driven cybersecurity platform across isolated enterprise environments. This is a unique opportunity to join as one of the early engineering team members of a well-funded startup building at the intersection of generative AI and cybersecurity. You'll design, code, and maintain sophisticated infrastructure spanning 12-15 AWS accounts, each with dedicated Kubernetes clusters, ensuring complete data segregation for our security-conscious enterprise customers. You'll take full ownership of our infrastructure-as-code implementation, managing multiple Kubernetes clusters at scale using cutting-edge tools like Karpenter, Flux, and Kustomize. Your success will be measured by infrastructure reliability, deployment velocity, and your ability to build self-managed, distributed systems that scale elegantly as we grow from startup to enterprise scale. This role is perfect for a hands-on infrastructure engineer who has mastered complex Kubernetes deployments at scale, writes production-grade infrastructure code, and thrives on building simple, elegant solutions to complex distributed systems challenges. Your Contributions to Our Journey: Architect Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Infrastructure: Design, implement, and write infrastructure-as-code for our complex Kubernetes setup spanning multiple AWS accounts, ensuring each cluster is completely isolated for enterprise security requirements while maintaining operational efficiency Build Self-Managed, Distributed Systems: Develop infrastructure that manages itself through GitOps workflows using Flux and Kustomize, creating distributed systems where actions in one place automatically trigger appropriate changes across the infrastructure without manual intervention Scale Kubernetes Operations: Manage and optimize dozens of Kubernetes clusters across our multi-tenant and single-tenant environments, implementing auto-scaling solutions with Karpenter and ensuring seamless scaling as customer workloads grow exponentially Develop Production-Grade Automation: Write robust, maintainable code to build and maintain CI/CD pipelines, custom automation tools, and deployment scripts that enable rapid feature delivery while maintaining the highest reliability standards Ensure Enterprise Security: Implement security best practices and compliance measures that protect our highly sensitive security data, managing firewalls, encryption, IAM policies, and network segregation across our multi-account AWS architecture Optimize Platform Performance: Build comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting systems that proactively identify issues, using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to ensure our infrastructure scales efficiently as we handle increasingly complex workloads Enable Engineering Velocity: Work closely with backend and data engineering teams to build self-service infrastructure capabilities, allowing teams to provision databases, deploy services, and scale resources independently without constant infrastructure team involvement What You Need to Be Successful: Kubernetes Mastery at Scale: 5+ years of infrastructure/DevOps experience with deep, hands-on expertise managing complex Kubernetes deployments—you must have experience with multiple Kubernetes clusters (tens of clusters) in sophisticated setups, not just simple single-cluster environments GitOps and Modern K8s Tooling: Proven production experience with Karpenter (for auto-scaling), Flux (for GitOps), and Kustomize (for configuration management)—if you have these three, you'll be a fish in the water with our infrastructure approach AWS Infrastructure Expertise: Deep knowledge of AWS with hands-on experience managing complex multi-account architectures, understanding how to design for isolation, security, and scalability across numerous AWS accounts with proper networking and IAM configuration Infrastructure-as-Code Excellence: Strong coding skills with production experience using Terraform or CloudFormation, writing maintainable, well-architected infrastructure code that follows best practices and scales with organizational growth. Proficiency in Python is essential for automation, tooling, and infrastructure development Hands-On Coding: Currently active as a developer writing production code in Python for infrastructure automation, custom tooling, and operational scripts—you're not just an architect who delegates implementation Simplicity-Driven Architecture: Proven ability to build simple, elegant solutions to complex infrastructure problems—you instinctively know the \"right way\" to use tools like Helm charts and avoid over-engineering while maintaining scalability Platform Thinking: Experience building infrastructure with a platform mindset, creating systems that support multiple products and enable team self-service rather than building one-off solutions for individual applications AWS Managed Services Philosophy: Understanding of when to use AWS managed services (RDS, MSK, EMR) versus building custom solutions, with experience scaling startups using managed services efficiently before investing in complex self-hosted infrastructure Distributed Systems Mindset: Deep understanding of distributed systems principles with experience building infrastructure that is decentralized rather than centralized, allowing independent operation across multiple clusters and regions Nice to haves: Experience with AWS auto-scaling across complex, multi-cluster environments Background in security-focused infrastructure or handling sensitive enterprise data Previous experience at scale-ups that grew infrastructure from 20-100+ engineers Knowledge of infrastructure observability tools beyond Prometheus/Grafana (e.g., ELK Stack) Track record of building infrastructure that went through SOC2, ISO, or similar compliance certifications Why Join Us: Ambitious Infrastructure Challenges: We're using generative AI (LLMs and agents) to solve critical cybersecurity challenges, requiring sophisticated infrastructure that handles sensitive security data across isolated enterprise environments. You'll build the foundation for breakthrough AI-powered security solutions at unprecedented scale. Expert Team: We are a team of hands-on leaders with deep experience in Big Tech and Scale-ups. Our team has been part of the leadership teams behind multiple acquisitions and an IPO. Impactful Work: Cybersecurity is a force for good—helping stop cyber attacks ultimately helps deliver better outcomes for all of us. The infrastructure you build will directly enable security teams to protect organizations worldwide from real threats. Build an AI-Native Company: We're building a new company in the AI era with the opportunity to design everything from the ground up—you'll architect infrastructure using cutting-edge Kubernetes practices and establish platform standards that will scale with us from startup through hypergrowth. Technical Leadership Growth: Direct partnership with experienced engineering leadership, significant equity upside, and the opportunity to own and shape the entire infrastructure function as we scale our platform to support the world's largest enterprises.
