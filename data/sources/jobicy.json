    "description": "About GiveDirectly GiveDirectly (GD) aims to reshape international giving – and millions of lives – by providing cash grants directly to the world’s poorest. The Brookings Institution estimates that $70B of cash transfers would be required to eliminate the poverty gap; the aid sector currently spends $135B each year, much of it on evidence-free interventions. GiveDirectly wants to change that, establishing cash transfers as a benchmark for foreign aid – as the index fund is a benchmark for the financial industry – and in the process accelerating the end of extreme poverty. GD has raised over $1B since launching in 2011, delivered cash to more than 1.5 million people in 15 different countries. We’ve also supported large-scale, experimental research that indicates strong recipient impact of our programs. As a result, GD has been celebrated as one of the most innovative non-profit companies by Fast Company , while the growing cash transfer movement (and GD’s leading role within it) have been featured in the New York Times Magazine , This American Life , Foreign Affairs , and The Economist . Our culture is candid, analytical, agile, and non-hierarchical. Our global team of ~150, and country operations teams of ~650, together come from 21 different countries speaking 69 different languages. From software engineers to seasoned humanitarian workers, former management consultants to public servants, researchers to field operations &#8212; it’s an incredible group of people. Our values are central and deliberately opinionated. We genuinely center the people we serve in our decision making, and strive to build an ambitious, dynamic and high performing environment. We strongly encourage you to read through our values carefully, if they reflect how you like to work and energize you, this could be a great fit.

We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of employment Visas in the U.S. or U.K. at this time.

We’re hiring a Senior Software Engineer to help build the systems behind this work. Our engineering team still operates like a startup within GiveDirectly—lean, fast-moving, and high-autonomy.

Improve our developer workflows by strengthening CI/CD pipelines, reducing manual steps, and increasing test coverage.

Debug and resolve production issues across our stack, with a focus on root cause analysis and long-term fixes. Advocate for sustainable engineering practices, including testing, documentation, and monitoring Help shape our tech roadmap with an eye toward scale, maintainability, and recipient experience What you’ll bring: Exceptional alignment with GiveDirectly Values and active demonstration of our core competencies: emotional intelligence, problem solving, project management, follow-through, and fostering inclusivity.

Collaborate cross-functionally with product managers, designers, and engineers to deliver impactful features. Continuously enhance engineering processes, tools, and practices within an agile environment. What you bring: 5–8 years of professional software engineering experience, with substantial expertise coding in Golang (ideally in product-based companies). Strong programming fundamentals, problem-solving ability, and system design skills. Deep understanding of concurrency, multi-threading, and distributed computing concepts. Experience building microservices architectures and developing RESTful APIs. Excellent analytical and reasoning skills, particularly in visualizing and simplifying complex systems. Experience with high-throughput, low-latency systems is highly desirable. Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS/GCP), NoSQL databases, big data analytics, or machine learning services is a plus. Growth mindset with a genuine desire to learn, grow, and contribute to building best-in-class backend systems.

    "company": "Socure",
    "description": "Why Socure? Socure is building the identity trust infrastructure for the digital economy — verifying 100% of good identities in real time and stopping fraud before it starts. The mission is big, the problems are complex, and the impact is felt by businesses, governments, and millions of people every day. We hire people who want that level of responsibility. People who move fast, think critically, act like owners, and care deeply about solving customer problems with precision. If you want predictability or narrow scope, this won’t be your place. If you want to help build the future of identity with a team that holds a high bar for itself — keep reading. At Socure, we are revolutionizing digital trust by building mission-critical systems that deliver high reliability and operate at global scale. As a Manager, Software Engineering, you will be a hands-on technical leader who defines direction, raises engineering standards, and delivers measurable product outcomes, all while remaining deeply involved in design and development. This is not a traditional people-management or delivery-management role—here, you will write code, architect solutions, lead complex projects, and coach engineers to maximize their potential. This role is perfect for leaders seeking high-growth, product-driven environments, who are passionate about distributed systems, and who want to directly influence the design of secure, scalable, and resilient infrastructure while cultivating top engineering talent. What You&#8217;ll Do: Architect and design scalable, resilient, high-performance backend systems and platforms in AWS, prioritizing reliability, security, and cost efficiency. Contribute hands-on to key initiatives—including design reviews, prototyping, coding, performance tuning, and debugging—typically 30% of your time, while mentoring engineers and establishing high standards. Lead cross-team technical initiatives; drive design forums, establish engineering guardrails, and ensure high-quality delivery via code reviews and automation. Partner closely with Product, Design, Data Science, and Platform teams to define project scope, sequence milestones, and proactively de-risk execution for iterative releases. Own design of APIs and microservices, including REST and event-driven patterns, and enforce best practices for versioning, contracts, and backward compatibility. Advance operational excellence by defining SLOs, improving observability and alerting, hardening on-call procedures and runbooks, and leading incident response and post-mortems. Solve complex distributed system challenges (such as throughput, latency, consistency, and data modeling) with pragmatic decision-making and balanced tradeoffs. Document architectural decisions, service ownership, and operational runbooks to share knowledge and maintain long-term scalability. Foster team growth through clear expectations, actionable feedback, and mentorship; hire, develop, and onboard diverse talent committed to a culture of ownership and collaboration. What You Bring: 10+ years of professional software engineering experience, including ownership of large-scale backend systems in production. 3+ years of hands-on technical leadership (as Tech Lead or Manager) with a track record of leading complex, cross-team projects while contributing to code and design. 5+ years of experience with Golang (preferred) and/or Java, plus strong computer science fundamentals (data structures, concurrency, distributed systems). Deep understanding of AWS cloud-native architectures and services (e.g., ECS/EKS, Lambda, OpenSearch, DynamoDB, RDS, S3) and resilience patterns. Proficiency with microservices, API design, and event-driven systems, as well as experience with containerization and orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes). Strong operational mindset: expert in observability, monitoring, incident response, performance engineering, and adherence to security best practices. Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines, automated testing strategies (unit, integration, e2e), and modern DevOps workflows; comfortable with Git-based trunk/branch strategies. Excellent communication, stakeholder management, and decision-making skills; able to clearly frame tradeoffs and drive alignment across engineering and product teams. Socure is an equal opportunity employer that values diversity in all its forms within our company. We do not discriminate based on race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

You prefer to achieve results today rather than waiting for tomorrow.</li>\n<li><strong>You can toggle between strategic and tactical:</strong> you’re equally comfortable with thinking through complex problems and getting into the weeds to execute.</li>\n<li><strong>You are an eager learner: </strong>ecomm, tech and digital spaces are rapidly evolving, but you enjoy learning how to incorporate new technologies into your approach and are ready to self-teach by diving into technical documentation.</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>Why you’ll love working at DoorDash</strong></h2><ul>\n<li><strong>We are leaders:</strong> Leadership is not limited to our management team.

    "description": "Founded in 2018 with co-headquarters in Dublin and Boston, Tines powers some of the world&#8217;s most important workflows. Our intelligent workflow platform applies AI, automation, and integration with human ingenuity to drive real business results. Tines serves a diverse range of customers, from startups to public companies, including Canva, Databricks, Elastic, Kayak, Intercom, and McKesson. As an integrator across the entire tech stack, Tines is vendor-agnostic integrating with any API-enabled service. This flexibility enables our customers to achieve their highest-priority goals faster. And because Tines is secure and private by design, it’s popular with security, IT, engineering, finance, and other security-focused teams. At Tines, we&#8217;re driven by our values of Simplicity, Speed, and Soundness. We&#8217;re committed to delivering exceptional customer experiences while fostering a company culture that nurtures individual curiosity, growth, and integrity. We’re excited about what’s next, and we’re looking for others to join us on our journey. You’ll join the team primarily responsible for building AI-powered product features and maintaining the AI platform that supports them. You’ll build complete product features as well as tooling and libraries to enable other engineers to build higher quality software. However, we’re still a small but growing software engineering organization, so this role is not strictly limited to any single part of our product or stack. This role is about more than writing code: you&#8217;ll have an influential voice in shaping our technical direction, our product, and our culture. We have a hugely supportive and collaborative engineering team that takes great pride in the work we do and the challenges we solve. We’re eager to help grow and nurture each other’s abilities and also create an environment where we have the ability to do our very best work. You can work fully remote within Ireland, and avail of working in our Dublin office as much as you wish. In this role, you’ll: Work closely with colleagues to build the right solutions to the problems our customers face. Make valuable changes in our codebase in your first week, and see them live in production minutes after merging them. Write and review high quality, well tested code to ensure that we’re creating a stable product for our customers, and a stress-free codebase for ourselves. Identify areas for improvement, both in our codebase and in how we work, and share the responsibility of making our team better. Own the problems you’re solving &#8211; and the software you write to solve them &#8211; all the way to production and beyond, responding to customer feedback to improve those solutions. Use your knowledge to mentor other engineers in our team, providing support and guidance to help them grow their abilities. Projects you might work on: Enhance and maintain the core AI platform at Tines, ensuring high performance and scalability. Develop best-in-class tools and documentation to simplify AI feature integration and platform use for other teams. Research and introduce new models and AI capabilities to improve product offerings. Support and optimize the deployment of AI models in self-hosted environments. Collaborate with our Product and Design teams to build out entire product features, like Workbench and AI agents from early tech plans to final UI fixes. Write and publish insightful blog posts to share key learnings, breakthroughs, and innovative approaches with the broader community. Is this role right for you? Roughly 3-5 years as a professional software engineer. This is a role for software engineers with some experience who are looking for a supportive environment where they can develop their skills towards becoming a senior software engineer. You’ll need direct experience of building and delivering software using a high-level programming language. Our interview process includes a Byteboard exercise which involves adding features to a small command-line app, so you should feel very comfortable working at that level of technical complexity. Our main languages are Ruby and TypeScript, but you don’t have to be familiar with those &#8211; we value curiosity and an eagerness to learn. We’ll also cover the cost of education material to bring you up to speed. Your abilities matter, not your education or exactly where you’ve worked. We just need you to show us that you have accumulated the foundational skills and knowledge needed to succeed. Cybersecurity knowledge isn’t required. We take application security seriously, but for this role you don’t need any experience in that area. This role is broad, not specialized. While your main focus will be on building AI-powered product features and maintaining the AI platform, you’ll work right across our stack. You don’t need to have experience in all of these areas, but you will need to be excited to pitch in anywhere when needed, with the support of your teammates. This allows us to be more effective as a team, and provides a lot of opportunities for you to learn. We’re focused on the most important problems, not the most interesting ones. Your time and energy are limited, so in order to succeed you’ll need to spend it where it will make a difference. We view technologies as a means to an end, and stick to simple, common tools &#8211; Ruby, Rails, React, TypeScript, Postgres, Redis and Docker. Our main languages are Ruby and TypeScript, but you don’t have to be familiar with those &#8211; we value curiosity and an eagerness to learn. We’ll also cover the cost of education material to bring you up to speed. We work healthily and sustainably. We work reasonable hours, we take our holidays and we plan our workloads realistically. No matter how excited we get by a project, it’s more important to not get burnt out from overwork. Your contributions will be obvious. On a small team like ours, you don’t have to spend a tonne of time and energy making sure your work is seen &#8211; your impact will be clear to everyone. We’re building an inclusive, supportive team. We have a wonderfully wide spectrum of colleagues at Tines, and we treat them all with kindness and respect &#8211; we expect that you will too. We don’t hire people that treat their colleagues badly, no matter how talented they are. We’re bringing programming to everyone. As software engineers, we can appreciate the power of using software to automate manual work. In our team, we get to use our knowledge to help bring this power to our customers, without them having to learn how to code. At Tines, we’re all about trying new things and taking the leap. If you’re second-guessing your application, we hope you’ll trust your gut and take the leap too! Applying for a new job isn’t always easy, especially if you’re thinking of a career pivot – but we’re big believers in learning and growth here at Tines, so you’ve nothing to worry about. A variety of experience, perspectives, and voices makes us the company we are . We’d love to hear from you. Tines provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation.",

      "jobDescription": "<p>Founded in 2018 with co-headquarters in Dublin and Boston, Tines powers some of the world&#8217;s most important workflows. Our intelligent workflow platform applies AI, automation, and integration with human ingenuity to drive real business results. </p><p>Tines serves a diverse range of customers, from startups to public companies, including Canva, Databricks, Elastic, Kayak, Intercom, and McKesson. As an integrator across the entire tech stack, Tines is vendor-agnostic integrating with any API-enabled service. This flexibility enables our customers to achieve their highest-priority goals faster. And because Tines is secure and private by design, it’s popular with security, IT, engineering, finance, and other security-focused teams.</p><p>At Tines, we&#8217;re driven by our values of Simplicity, Speed, and Soundness. We&#8217;re committed to delivering exceptional customer experiences while fostering a company culture that nurtures individual curiosity, growth, and integrity. We’re excited about what’s next, and we’re looking for others to join us on our journey.</p><p>You’ll join the team primarily responsible for building AI-powered product features and maintaining the AI platform that supports them. You’ll build complete product features as well as tooling and libraries to enable other engineers to build higher quality software. However, we’re still a small but growing software engineering organization, so this role is not strictly limited to any single part of our product or stack.</p><p>This role is about more than writing code: you&#8217;ll have an influential voice in shaping our technical direction, our product, and our culture. We have a hugely supportive and collaborative engineering team that takes great pride in the work we do and the challenges we solve. We’re eager to help grow and nurture each other’s abilities and also create an environment where we have the ability to do our very best work.</p><p>You can work fully remote within Ireland, and avail of working in our Dublin office as much as you wish. </p><h3><strong>In this role, you’ll:</strong></h3><ul>\n<li>Work closely with colleagues to build the right solutions to the problems our customers face.</li>\n<li>Make valuable changes in our codebase in your first week, and see them live in production minutes after merging them.</li>\n<li>Write and review high quality, well tested code to ensure that we’re creating a stable product for our customers, and a stress-free codebase for ourselves.</li>\n<li>Identify areas for improvement, both in our codebase and in how we work, and share the responsibility of making our team better.</li>\n<li>Own the problems you’re solving &#8211; and the software you write to solve them &#8211; all the way to production and beyond, responding to customer feedback to improve those solutions.</li>\n<li>Use your knowledge to mentor other engineers in our team, providing support and guidance to help them grow their abilities.</li>\n</ul><h3><strong>Projects you might work on:</strong></h3><ul>\n<li>Enhance and maintain the core AI platform at Tines, ensuring high performance and scalability.</li>\n<li>Develop best-in-class tools and documentation to simplify AI feature integration and platform use for other teams.</li>\n<li>Research and introduce new models and AI capabilities to improve product offerings.</li>\n<li>Support and optimize the deployment of AI models in self-hosted environments.</li>\n<li>Collaborate with our Product and Design teams to build out entire product features, like<a href=\"https://www.tines.com/product/workbench/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Workbench </a>and <a href=\"https://www.tines.com/platform/agents/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AI agents</a> from early tech plans to final UI fixes.</li>\n<li>Write and publish insightful<a href=\"https://www.tines.com/blog/understanding-why-our-build-got-15x-slower-with-webpack-5/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> blog posts</a> to share key learnings, breakthroughs, and innovative approaches with the broader community.</li>\n</ul><h3><strong>Is this role right for you?</strong></h3><ul>\n<li><strong>Roughly 3-5 years as a professional software engineer.</strong> This is a role for software engineers with some experience who are looking for a supportive environment where they can develop their skills towards becoming a senior software engineer.</li>\n<li><strong>You’ll need direct experience of building and delivering software using a high-level programming language. </strong>Our interview process includes a<a href=\"https://byteboard.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Byteboard</a> exercise which involves adding features to a small command-line app, so you should feel very comfortable working at that level of technical complexity. Our main languages are Ruby and TypeScript, but you don’t have to be familiar with those &#8211; we value curiosity and an eagerness to learn. We’ll also cover the cost of education material to bring you up to speed.</li>\n<li><strong>Your abilities matter, not your education or exactly where you’ve worked.</strong> We just need you to show us that you have accumulated the foundational skills and knowledge needed to succeed.</li>\n<li><strong>Cybersecurity knowledge isn’t required.</strong> We take application security seriously, but for this role you don’t need any experience in that area.</li>\n<li><strong>This role is broad, not specialized. </strong>While your main focus will be on building AI-powered product features and maintaining the AI platform, you’ll work right across our stack. You don’t need to have experience in all of these areas, but you will need to be excited to pitch in anywhere when needed, with the support of your teammates. This allows us to be more effective as a team, and provides a lot of opportunities for you to learn.</li>\n<li><strong>We’re focused on the most important problems, not the most interesting ones.</strong> Your time and energy are limited, so in order to succeed you’ll need to spend it where it will make a difference. We view technologies as a means to an end, and stick to simple, common tools &#8211; Ruby, Rails, React, TypeScript, Postgres, Redis and Docker. Our main languages are Ruby and TypeScript, but you don’t have to be familiar with those &#8211; we value curiosity and an eagerness to learn. We’ll also cover the cost of education material to bring you up to speed.</li>\n<li><strong>We work healthily and sustainably.</strong> We work reasonable hours, we take our holidays and we plan our workloads realistically. No matter how excited we get by a project, it’s more important to not get burnt out from overwork.</li>\n<li><strong>Your contributions will be obvious.</strong> On a small team like ours, you don’t have to spend a tonne of time and energy making sure your work is seen &#8211; your impact will be clear to everyone.</li>\n<li><strong>We’re building an inclusive, supportive team.</strong> We have a wonderfully wide spectrum of colleagues at Tines, and we treat them all with kindness and respect &#8211; we expect that you will too. We don’t hire people that treat their colleagues badly, no matter how talented they are.</li>\n<li><strong>We’re bringing programming to everyone.</strong> As software engineers, we can appreciate the power of using software to automate manual work. In our team, we get to use our knowledge to help bring this power to our customers, without them having to learn how to code.</li>\n</ul><p></p><p>At Tines, we’re all about trying new things and taking the leap. If you’re second-guessing your application, we hope you’ll trust your gut and take the leap too! Applying for a new job isn’t always easy, especially if you’re thinking of a career pivot – but we’re big believers in learning and growth here at Tines, so you’ve nothing to worry about. A variety of experience, perspectives, and voices makes us <a href=\"https://www.tines.com/blog/inside-tines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">the company we are</a>. We’d love to hear from you.</p><p><strong><em>Tines provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation.</em></strong></p>",

    "description": "POS-15631 Hubspot Engineering We ship customer-centered, autonomous product teams that take features from idea to production and support them in production. We care about building reliable, maintainable systems and a culture of learning and inclusion. About the team The A&amp;B team owns the central customer-facing hub for subscription and billing management, powering over $3 billion in annual recurring revenue. While many teams touch billing, A&amp;B is responsible for making Account &amp; Billing the single destination where customers understand what they have, manage their subscription, and take action. The team balances two roles: stewarding the A&amp;B surface area with clear ownership of tabs, components, and workflows, and coordinating cross-team initiatives that eliminate friction across the broader billing journey. This includes driving comprehension of usage and billing, enabling self-service modifications within policy bounds, and providing seamless paths to upgrade. Why this role matters A successful Senior Software Engineer on the Account &amp; Billing Experience team will make it easy for customers to understand bills and usage, reduce support dependency by expanding self-service coverage, and lead cross-functional programs that simplify complex subscription journeys. You’ll work end-to-end with collaboration from backend and product partners. What you’ll do Own major frontend surface areas in the Account &amp; Billing hub &#8211; tabs, components, and end-to-end workflows &#8211; delivering high-quality, reliable, and accessible experiences. Align product, design, backend, and go-to-market partners to solve end-to-end customer problems. Ship scalable, maintainable TypeScript + React code, with attention to performance, observability, testing, and UX edge cases. Translate customer pain points and data into concrete product improvements that reduce friction (e.g., seat management, delta billing, marketing contacts limits). Expand self-service capabilities so more billing actions are available without human intervention, while ensuring changes stay within policy bounds. Mentor and raise the bar for other engineers on the team through code reviews, pairing, and shared technical ownership. Contribute to frontend architecture and the team’s design system/components; scope and deliver safely for enterprise and SMB customers. Measure outcomes and iterate: work with PM and analytics to set success metrics, instrument features, and act on feedback. What we’re looking for Strong frontend experience (typically 5+ years ) building production web applications with TypeScript and React . Deep product and UX sensibility: you can reason about user flows, edge cases, and how design decisions impact customer comprehension. Experience delivering end-to-end features and owning surface areas (components, pages, instrumentation, and rollout). Proven ability to lead cross-team efforts and influence without formal authority. Solid engineering fundamentals: testing, performance optimization, accessibility, observability, and CI/CD. Excellent collaboration and communication skills — you’ll work closely with PMs, designers, backend engineers, customer-facing teams, and stakeholders. Comfortable working in a fast-moving environment and mentoring less-experienced engineers. Nice-to-haves Prior experience with billing, subscriptions, payments, or Fintech products. Experience with GraphQL/REST at scale, complex client-side state management (Redux/MobX/relay), and component design systems. History of improving CSAT or operational metrics through product/engineering work. Familiarity with enterprise purchasing and seat management patterns. Knowledge of privacy/security considerations for billing/financial data. What success looks like after 6–12 months You own and reliably deliver improvements to one or more A&amp;B surface areas (tabs/components/workflows). Measurable increases in self-service coverage for targeted billing actions. Clear wins on Billing CSAT priorities and demonstrated cross-team leadership on at least one major initiative.

    "description": "Who we are Samsara (NYSE: IOT) is the pioneer of the Connected Operations™ Cloud, which is a platform that enables organizations that depend on physical operations to harness Internet of Things (IoT) data to develop actionable insights and improve their operations. At Samsara, we are helping improve the safety, efficiency and sustainability of the physical operations that power our global economy. Representing more than 40% of global GDP, these industries are the infrastructure of our planet, including agriculture, construction, field services, transportation, and manufacturing — and we are excited to help digitally transform their operations at scale. Working at Samsara means you’ll help define the future of physical operations and be on a team that’s shaping an exciting array of product solutions, including Video-Based Safety, Vehicle Telematics, Apps and Driver Workflows, and Equipment Monitoring. As part of a recently public company, you’ll have the autonomy and support to make an impact as we build for the long term. About the role: As Software &amp; ML Engineering Manager – New Products, you’ll lead a small, high-calibre team (starting ~10 SWE/ML engineers, with clear scope to grow) building a new approach to how Samsara turns telematics data into action. The mission: detect anomalies across vast fleets — theft, misuse, suspicious stops, GPS jamming, emerging risk patterns — and surface the right incidents to the right operators, fast, with clear workflows to move from signal to resolution. This is a 0-to-1 leadership role with real visibility and real-world impact. You’ll partner closely with Product, Firmware, and Design to ship end-to-end capabilities across hardware, firmware, and cloud software — building intelligent detection (ML + heuristics), real-time alerting, and an operator-friendly incident experience at scale. In this role, you will: Recruit, hire, mentor, and grow an inclusive, high-performing team of software and ML engineers. Turn ambiguous “new product” bets into a clear roadmap, technical strategy, and shipped customer value. Build systems that analyse large-scale telematics data and detect anomalies across fleets — not just per-vehicle troubleshooting. Lead delivery of end-to-end security and incident workflows, from detection to investigation to resolution. Guide the team in applying ML and modern AI techniques (including LLMs where they add leverage) to create differentiated capabilities. Partner deeply with Product, Design, Firmware, and Data Science to deliver cohesive experiences across the stack. Champion engineering excellence: architecture quality, reliability, and thoughtful scoping — while keeping velocity high. Keep the team close to customers: rapid prototyping, direct feedback loops, and outcome-driven iteration. Champion, role model, and embed Samsara’s cultural principles (Focus on Customer Success, Build for the Long Term, Adopt a Growth Mindset, Be Inclusive, Win as a Team) as we scale globally and across new offices. Minimum requirements for the role: 6+ years of professional software development experience. 3+ years of formal people management experience in a product-driven engineering environment. Degree in Computer Science/Engineering (or equivalent practical experience). Strong technical judgement and curiosity — you’re willing to dive into complex systems and messy real-world data. Clear, confident communicator who builds trust across engineering, product, and cross-functional partners. Passion for developing engineers and building a team culture that raises the bar. An ideal candidate also has: Experience thriving in ambiguity — “startup DNA” in a high-growth environment. Hands-on ML experience (building with, deploying, or fine-tuning models) and the ability to guide ML work pragmatically. Strong understanding of the data lifecycle and how to maintain integrity across distributed systems without creating silos. Track record of shipping and scaling products used by large customer bases. At Samsara, we welcome everyone regardless of their background. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, protected veteran status, disability, age, and other characteristics protected by law. We depend on the unique approaches of our team members to help us solve complex problems and want to ensure that Samsara is a place where people from all backgrounds can make an impact. Benefits Full time employees receive a competitive total compensation package along with employee-led remote and flexible working, health benefits, and much, much more. Take a look at our Benefits site to learn more. Accommodations Samsara is an inclusive work environment, and we are committed to ensuring equal opportunity in employment for qualified persons with disabilities. Please email accessibleinterviewing@samsara.com or click here if you require any reasonable accommodations throughout the recruiting process. Flexible Working At Samsara, we embrace a flexible working model that caters to the diverse needs of our teams. Our offices are open for those who prefer to work in-person and we also support remote work where it aligns with our operational requirements. For certain positions, being close to one of our offices or within a specific geographic area is important to facilitate collaboration, access to resources, or alignment with our service regions. In these cases, the job description will clearly indicate any working location requirements. Our goal is to ensure that all members of our team can contribute effectively, whether they are working on-site, in a hybrid model, or fully remotely. All offers of employment are contingent upon an individual’s ability to secure and maintain the legal right to work at the company and in the specified work location, if applicable.

We operate with a DevOps culture – engineers own their code from development through production Key Responsibilities Develop Core Communication Services: Build and maintain backend services for voice/video calling (signaling servers, call routing logic, media gateways) using SIP and WebRTC. Implement features like call setup, conferencing, transfers, and recording with a focus on efficiency and reliability. Enhance Audio Quality (DSP): Implement and tune digital signal processing algorithms for superior call audio. This includes noise suppression, echo cancellation, jitter buffer optimization, and voice activity detection to ensure crystal-clear, uninterrupted communication even on poor networks. Optimize Media &amp; Codecs: Work with real-time media streaming (RTP) and various codecs (Opus, G.711, H.264, etc.). Optimize codec configurations and adapt bitrates on the fly based on network conditions to balance quality and bandwidth. Integrate Voice AI Features: Embed speech-to-text (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities into the platform. Enable AI voice agents to participate in calls by streaming audio to AI services and injecting synthesized speech responses. Manage conversation flow between humans and AI (handling interruptions, timing responses) to make interactions feel natural. Ensure Scalability &amp; Resilience: Design services with a cloud-native approach (microservices, containers) for deployment on Kubernetes. Implement high-availability strategies (clustering, failover) across global data centers so that the platform achieves five-9s uptime with no downtime for maintenance. Performance &amp; Reliability Tuning: Continuously profile and improve system performance end-to-end. Minimize call setup times and audio latency through efficient coding (C/C++ for media processing) and system optimizations. DevOps &amp; Support: Use CI/CD pipelines to deploy updates safely with zero downtime. Write comprehensive automated tests (unit, integration, load) for your features. Participate in on-call rotation to troubleshoot and resolve production issues in real time, and implement lasting solutions to prevent recurrence. Collaboration: Work closely with Product Managers, front-end teams, AI/ML team and with network engineers. Qualifications Real-Time Communications: 5+ years of experience developing VoIP or real-time communication systems. Strong knowledge of SIP protocol, WebRTC, and related networking (RTP, NAT traversal). Proven ability to implement call logic and troubleshoot signaling and media issues. Audio/DSP Expertise: Hands-on experience with audio processing in real time. Familiarity with noise reduction, echo cancellation, jitter buffers, and other voice QoS techniques. Comfort optimizing or using audio codecs (Opus, G.711, etc.) and improving call quality under varying network conditions. Strong Coding Skills: Proficiency in C/C++ for high-performance, multi-threaded systems programming. Experience writing efficient, low-latency code (lock-free structures, memory management). Additionally, skilled with a higher-level language like Go or Java for building microservices and control logic. Cloud &amp; Scalability: Experience building and deploying services in a cloud-native environment (Docker, Kubernetes). Knowledge of designing scalable microservices and using cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, or Azure) for load balancing, monitoring, and fault tolerance. Voice AI Familiarity: Exposure to integrating speech recognition and text-to-speech in applications. You’ve perhaps worked with voice assistants, IVR systems, or call center AI – you understand basic latency/accuracy trade-offs and how to interface with speech APIs/SDKs. Security &amp; Compliance: Basic understanding of securing voice communications (TLS, SRTP) and safeguarding customer data (GDPR, HIPAA considerations for call recordings, etc.). Designs solutions with privacy and security best practices in mind. DevOps Mindset: Comfortable using CI/CD, infrastructure-as-code, and logging/monitoring tools. Willing to take ownership of code in production – debugging live issues, optimizing resource usage, and responding to incidents. Team Player: Excellent collaboration and communication skills. Experience working in Agile teams. Ability to clearly document designs and mentor others. A proactive attitude to problem-solving and an enthusiasm for continuous learning in the fast-evolving communications and AI field.
