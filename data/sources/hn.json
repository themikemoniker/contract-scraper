No open reqs at this time but maybe in May&#x2F;June.<p>In order to be vague I’ll use buzzwords: it’s a B2B PaaS in the security area. They have a MVP customer already though tech is still in development.  Idea was to develop as fast as possible and secure some anchor customers. Turns out the current situation makes that plan even better because there’s less distraction. It helps that this product is an “aspirin” unlike (in my experience) most security products.<p>In my experience downturns kill medium sized companies most. Big companies will survive revenue downturns and tiny B2B companies like the one I’m joining can survive on one or two anchor customers because they are relatively merely sipping cash (even with SV salaries). Acquiring <i>new</i> enterprise customers is hard in a downturn though.  Of course this downturn appears to be extreme so who knows.  And if your product is B2C things may be disproportionally worse for you.<p>Also FB is still actively interviewing (at least they were last week!) to fill open reqs and likely other big companies are too. That may change as the economy declines but for now that appears to be the case. In fact “shelter at home” is great for companies like them.  Of course I have no special visibility into their thoughts.",

At Notion, our goal to create the general purpose work tool for a post-file, post-MS Office world. My cofounder and I often joke that this was like the \"hot startup topic\" of the 90s. Unfortunately, tools for knowledge workers haven't advanced much since then. The state of art is either Google Docs/Quip/Dropbox Paper (multiplayer WordPerfect), or rigid SAAS apps (forms + a table+ some buttons).\n\nThis is our product: https://notion.so\n\nWe are looking for people with the following roles: https://www.notion.so/jobs\n\nWe made a graphic novel about why we exist: https://notion.so/about\n\nRead more reviews on WSJ and Product Hunt. (Notion was one of the fastest voted of all time): https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-only-app-you-need-for-work-.... https://www.producthunt.com/posts/notion-2-0\n\nWe are a bunch of artsy nerds in SF. The business is profitable and growing very fast. We have a beautiful artist loft in the SF Mission district, with some of the best investors out there (notion.so/about).\n\n== Apply =======================================\n\nPlease see details here ->> https://www.notion.so/jobs",

          "text": "I&#x27;m a CS grad with some work experience (1 year dev, 1 year coding bootcamp teacher). See me as a junior that ramps up quicker than the average junior (e.g. last month I owned a lot of boxes at hackthebox.eu for fun and was a top 5% after 2 weeks of non-stop playing [1]).<p>I wrote my thesis related to Engelbard. So I think we have a cultural click. Which is why I&#x27;m writing all this.<p>The reason I&#x27;m not applying but simply writing things here is because I&#x27;m tired of applying (it&#x27;s hard to hear more than 100+ &quot;no&quot; while at university you were a top student). But I do want to know if you guys think I&#x27;m worth considering.<p>Which is why I&#x27;m brutally honest with the following:<p>Companies tend to reject me due to lack of experience, and (in my opinion) undervalue how quick I can pick things up and how willing I am to work amazingly hard, especially at the beginning of a job. When they hire me they tend to be surprised with how wrong they were about me.<p>My strength is that I&#x27;m a generalist, much more so than most people. My weakness is that people have the perception that I can&#x27;t be a specialist. But anyone that gave me a chance in hiring me during my freelance time know that I am capable of performing one role as a specialist (full-stack developer with a business and security mindset).<p>During my good days I tend to have an Elon Musk mindset. He says that working 80 to 100 hours per week means you learn 2 to 2.5 times faster, I mostly agree -- I think it is sometimes more because the interconnectness of things pushes the multiple a bit higher. During my bad days I simply want to work 40 hours per week go home and relax. During these times I sort of don&#x27;t want to work due to stress, but know that I have to work because it keeps my mind sharp.<p>[1] I was in &quot;Elon Musk&quot; mode for a month.",

    "description": "Dremio | Full Stack and System Engineers | Santa Clara, CA | Onsite (once shelter-in-place ends) | https://www.dremio.com/\n\nWe are looking for Full Stack and System engineers.  Our stack is Java and React and open source our core technologies (such as Apache Arrow).\n\nDremio is the Data Lake Engine company. Our mission is to reshape the world of analytics to deliver on the promise of data with a fundamentally new architecture, purpose-built for the exploding trend towards cloud data lake storage such as AWS S3 and Microsoft ADLS. We dramatically reduce and even eliminate the need for the complex and expensive workarounds that have been in use for decades, such as data warehouses (whether on-premise or cloud-native), structural data prep, ETL, cubes, and extracts. We do this by enabling lightning-fast queries directly against data lake storage, combined with full self-service for data users and full governance and control for IT. The results for enterprises are extremely compelling: 100X faster time to insight; 10X greater efficiency; zero data copies; and game-changing simplicity. And equally compelling is the market opportunity for Dremio, as we are well on our way to disrupting a $25BN+ market.\n\nFind out more at https://www.dremio.com/careers/",

It's a big mission that we're taking on step by step. While we want anyone to be able to get a great education independently, we've been focusing a lot on trying to help teachers working in their classrooms (and a lot of teachers and parents are using Khan away from their classrooms right now!)\n\nOur site has been built on Python 2 and Google App Engine for its first 10 years of existence. We're now in the midst of a rebuild in Go (still on App Engine).[1] Parts of that new Go-based infrastructure are already running in production.\n\nTo say that this is an exciting time for us would be an understatement, I think, but we continue to have working sustainably as an engineering principle.

We believe that travel makes us and the world better, and are trying to lower the bar to it. Our product so far is a Google Docs for planning travel and sharing recommendations.\n\nWe’re currently a team of 5, including 4 engineers (counting twin-brother founders Peter and Harry as engineers) and 1 designer. Our stack is Typescript with Node.js, React, React Native, and excellent front-end and back-end test coverage.\n\nWe also love traveling. Whether it’s a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places members of the team have traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, allows us to bond with others on our trip! We’re working to bring these experiences to more of the world.\n\nIf you're interested in joining us, email me at peter@wanderlog.com or check out our job posting at https://wanderlog.com/blog/jobs/full-stack-engineer/",

We believe that travel makes us and the world better, and are trying to lower the bar to it. Our product so far is a Google Docs for planning travel and sharing recommendations.<p>We’re currently a team of 5, including 4 engineers (counting twin-brother founders Peter and Harry as engineers) and 1 designer. Our stack is Typescript with Node.js, React, React Native, and excellent front-end and back-end test coverage.<p>We also love traveling. Whether it’s a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places members of the team have traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, allows us to bond with others on our trip! We’re working to bring these experiences to more of the world.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in joining us, email me at peter@wanderlog.com or check out our job posting at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wanderlog.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;full-stack-engineer&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wanderlog.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;full-stack-engineer&#x2F;</a>",

We're also the world's top Kubernetes provider with OpenShift (well over 1000 customers). We're Ansible. We're OpneShift Dedicated and OpenShift Online (Hosted services). We're a huge company with openings in marketing, management, VPs also! We're worldwide. We have offices around the globe. We're all remote: the location listed in a job posting is where the manager is located. 90% of the time the job can be performed remotely.\n\nRed Hat is still Red Hat. In fact, even more so, now that our CEO is also President of IBM. Think Pixar and Disney, NeXT and Apple. We sell absolutely no software that is not 100% open source, unless we're in the process of open sourcing it. Even our acquired companies' software, we eventually open source. Have you contributed to an open source project? Ooooooooooo, we LOVE that! Come join us! I currently spend work hours helping the CNCF, for example!\n\nI've been here 18 months now, and they will have to drag me out the door. I'll probably never leave willingly.

They more strongly discourage it in these Hiring posts and it seems to me that&#x27;s the correct way to handle it because this is intended as a free advertising space, not a discussion space.<p>In part for purposes of making advertisers comfortable posting here so they will post at all, HN more strictly forbids attacks against the advertisers because that would drive away a lot of advertisers and harm the utility of these posts. But, also, these posts have a lot of little ads and it&#x27;s already a huge pile of info to sort through if you are job hunting, even without chit chat and ugly, long tangents thrown in.<p>HN likely doesn&#x27;t have the manpower to lock these threads and institute a pre approval process as the mechanism that protects these posts as 99% (free) ads. So they rely on certain social expectations to make this work.<p>Since the membership very much values these posts, the membership generally does a good job of respecting certain expectations.<p>There are spaces on the internet where the meme is &quot;This is why we can&#x27;t have nice things&quot; and it typically gets stated as a way to say &quot;It&#x27;s not the fault of incompetent moderation. No, the members are just assholes who won&#x27;t behave.&quot; (Often stated by the mods, who are incompetent and prone to putting out the fire with gasoline.)<p>HN has both competent moderation and members who more or less try hard to behave.

In fact, even more so, now that our CEO is also President of IBM. Think Pixar and Disney, NeXT and Apple. We sell absolutely no software that is not 100% open source, unless we&#x27;re in the process of open sourcing it. Even our acquired companies&#x27; software, we eventually open source.

    "description": "Vetspire | Full Stack Software Engineer | Austin, TX | Full-Time | https://vetspire.com\n\nVeterinary medicine is one of the essential services needed to be provided during the coronavirus pandemic. Every day, veterinarians risk themselves to take care of your pets, and we're working every day at Vetspire to build them the tools to do so while following social-distancing best practices.\n\nVetspire is an AI-driven medical records and practice management platform for veterinarians. We’re a startup that builds the technology suite that powers veterinary hospitals, impacting every aspect of patient care from AI assistance in the exam room to managing client communications and clinical analytics.\n\nWe're looking for a full stack engineer to join our small and technical team to help bring veterinarians’ dreams into fruition. Your day to day work will consist of learning and understanding veterinarians' and veterinary staff needs and bringing them into reality from the front-end to the backend.

We&#x27;re a (currently) small team with a big mission, so there is an enormous amount of ownership and influence that goes with this position.<p>Apply here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;framework&#x2F;6935fb47-2921-49df-b94c-e45c52a1b9a9\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;framework&#x2F;6935fb47-2921-49df-b94c-e45c...</a>",

We're a YC W19 graduate who's raised a seed round and looking to hire our second (non-founder) engineer. We've raised $1.5m, but aim to only hire one more engineer to keep our burn low.\n\nWe believe that travel makes us and the world better, and are trying to lower the bar to travel by bringing together all the information you need to travel in the best tool to organize your plans. Our product so far is a Google Docs for planning travel and sharing recommendations.\n\nWe’re an engineering and product-heavy team. A typical week’s work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks on a kanban, designing on Figma, and building and shipping continuously. Harry and I have worked at Stripe, McKinsey, and Google and studied Computer Science at Yale. We've built profitable travel businesses in the past, and at Wanderlog, we try to take the best parts of each of the our past workplaces and bring them together.\n\nWe believe in work-life balance. We work regular hours, take time off as a team to eat lunch together (and even cook!), exercise, and enjoy time with friends and family. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have quarterly travel offsites where the goal is to just enjoy visiting a new place and use the tools we’ve built.\n\nIf you enjoy travel, and would love to make it easier for the rest of the world to do it, send us a note at founders@wanderlog.com! We’d love for you to join our team.",

We&#x27;re a YC W19 graduate who&#x27;s raised a seed round and looking to hire our second (non-founder) engineer. We&#x27;ve raised $1.5m, but aim to only hire one more engineer to keep our burn low.<p>We believe that travel makes us and the world better, and are trying to lower the bar to travel by bringing together all the information you need to travel in the best tool to organize your plans. Our product so far is a Google Docs for planning travel and sharing recommendations.<p>We’re an engineering and product-heavy team. A typical week’s work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks on a kanban, designing on Figma, and building and shipping continuously. Harry and I have worked at Stripe, McKinsey, and Google and studied Computer Science at Yale. We&#x27;ve built profitable travel businesses in the past, and at Wanderlog, we try to take the best parts of each of the our past workplaces and bring them together.<p>We believe in work-life balance. We work regular hours, take time off as a team to eat lunch together (and even cook!), exercise, and enjoy time with friends and family. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have quarterly travel offsites where the goal is to just enjoy visiting a new place and use the tools we’ve built.<p>If you enjoy travel, and would love to make it easier for the rest of the world to do it, send us a note at founders@wanderlog.com! We’d love for you to join our team.",

It was launched in 2012 by former U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park, and since then, more than 150 Fellows have worked within over 35 agencies. Over half of the Fellows have decided to stay in government after the program, and have gone on to lead new digital teams and serve as chief technology officers, chief information officers, chief data officers, and chief marketing officers at various agencies.<p>Fellows are building products and services at scale to serve all Americans. Select potential projects for the Fall 2020 cohort include:<p>• Assisting the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid modernize their technology stack so they can better share data with stakeholders across the healthcare ecosystem.<p>• Helping NASA speed up the discovery, analysis and development of aerospace systems using artificial intelligence to ultimately help combat climate change by reducing fuel burn for the aerospace industry.<p>• Working with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to better support veterans transitioning from military to civilian life, adopt medical innovations to improve mental health services and health outcomes, and reduce the processing time for benefits claims.<p>• Collaborating with multiple federal agencies to drive the adoption of AI technologies across government.<p>• Ensuring that the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a U.S. foreign aid agency, and their partner countries have the data, technology, and innovations skills needed to maximize the impact of U.S. investments.<p>• Guiding the Department of Transportation as they adapt to the challenges and opportunities that autonomous vehicles and aerial systems offer.<p>• Helping the U.S. Marine Corps conduct a digital and data transformation to keep Marines safe.<p>Apply today: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.pif.gov\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apply.pif.gov</a><p>Learn more about us: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presidentialinnovationfellows.gov\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presidentialinnovationfellows.gov</a>",

While the impact of the pandemic on our core business will be uncertain, we think there is more merit than ever in the social mission of providing our users with systems that make their homes a more pleasant and safer place to be, as well as in providing TVs and radios that can provide lifesaving public health information. We are also well capitalized and in a stable position financially.\n\nOur engineering team is fully remote, but we currently only hire in the GMT-1 to GMT+3 timezone range to allow for a high degree of synchronous interaction (put differently: West Africa to Eastern Europe, North Pole to South Pole).\n\nWe are currently looking for a variety of senior .NET engineering and engineering management roles, so if you have that background/interest please reach out.

          "text": "This is a great team to consider at Twitter. But if this isn&#x27;t quite what you&#x27;re looking for, I&#x27;d just like to add that many teams at Twitter are specifically looking to hire people outside of San Francisco (either at other offices or working from home... but note that we don&#x27;t yet have the ability to directly employ people in every country). Protip: even if a job listing mentions a location different from where you live, apply anyway and mention where you&#x27;d want to work from. We are currently actively hiring for many teams (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.twitter.com</a>). For now, all interviews are virtual, including virtual office tours if you would intend to eventually work in one of our offices once they reopen after COVID-19 is under control. (Modulo the undeniable stress of current world events, which we all try to support each other through), the transition to 100% remote work has gone remarkably well.",

If it can understand code, with sufficient compute it can even synthesize it.<p>For the kinds of technical problems we handle, look at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthetic-minds.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;conference&#x2F;2019&#x2F;#program\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthetic-minds.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;conference&#x2F;2019&#x2F;#program</a><p>We are an all engineering team (including PhDs and ex-Googlers) backed by Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures and Pantera Capital.

          "text": "I&#x27;m sorry that you or someone you know ended up not receiving an offer. Twitter is indeed still hiring. While admittedly Twitter does hold a high bar for hiring, we put a lot of effort into making sure that our assessments are done fairly, based on the best we can tell about the candidate&#x27;s current level of technical and nontechnical skills relevant to the role. Sometimes this may mean teams continue the interview process further with candidates who seem promising but risky. When that does happen, it&#x27;s not because of a number of applicants metric (this isn&#x27;t a metric I&#x27;ve heard about internally), it&#x27;s because we want to give people a fair chance. Admittedly, there is a careful balance to be made between giving people the time to demonstrate how they shine and wasting candidates&#x27; time because it&#x27;s not the right role. There&#x27;s also cases where someone interviews for one role, doesn&#x27;t have the right skill set there, is referred to a different role, and then does very well and is hired. I don&#x27;t think any interview process at any company is perfect, but we are always trying to improve.<p>I&#x27;d also like to add that one of the ways we offer a level playing field for candidates is by strongly supporting remote work (which started long before COVID-19). We have multiple offices both within and outside of the United States, and many people who work from home in jurisdictions where we have the ability to employ people. Unlike the team in the grandparent comment, many Twitter engineering teams are currently particularly looking to hire outside of San Francisco (both to increase our geographic diversity and to reach the best candidates wherever they may be).<p>So if you&#x27;re looking for something new, like Twitter, and see a role on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.twitter.com</a> that you honestly feel is a good fit, please apply!",

We find people on the Internet that seem promising and give them \"Silicon Valley\", but on the Internet. It's a lot of gamification, Ruby software, Zoom, Slack, and fun. We've funded over 100 people around the world in 30+ countries. We direct them to YC once they graduate. (Tbc, we have no formal attachment to YC; just admiration.

    "description": "Pinterest Visual Search / Applied Computer Vision | San Francisco / Palo Alto for internships, REMOTE option for contractors | Applied ML Internships / full stack ML infrastructure engineering contracting roles\n\nThe Visual Search team works on all aspects of applied computer vision at Pinterest and is offering summer 2020 internship opportunities, along with contracting roles for industry veterans who are looking for a flexible arrangement. This is a full stack team, ultimately driven to ship user-facing products, like Pinterest Lens and Pinterest AR. We do this by building state of the art computer vision signals, such as fine-grained embeddings, high-throughput detection models, generative adversarial models for image composition, and many others.  These models and computer vision features power product experiences on Pinterest for hundreds of millions of users.\n\nPinterest Visual Search team runs on PyTorch, C++, and lots of Python, among with many other technologies. We encourage publication of all of our work (CVPR, KDD, etc.), and have a highly collaborative and flexible work environment. We’re broadly looking for two intern/eng. contractor categories: generalists and computer vision domain experts. If you’re passionate about product or computer vision infrastructure, such as building label-to-deployed-model toolchains via active learning, reach out to us about a generalist role. If you’ve had experience with interesting CV challenges, or are looking for a highly applied ML work, reach out regarding the CV domain role. You can contact me directly by pinging dkislyuk@pinterest.com with the tag [VISUAL SEARCH HN] in the title.

Those are not good signs. If HN is going to have a job board, it&#x27;s not fair to let just anyone come along, smear people&#x27;s posts, and significantly affect their company&#x27;s reputation, without any due process.<p>If that seems unduly restrictive to you, I understand. But we&#x27;ve seen many cases of people taking advantage of the public forum to smear others in dodgy or unfair ways. As I explained at that link above, bad corporate behavior is a thing, and bad internet commenter behavior is also a thing. An HN job thread is no place to adjudicate which is which, so we need to err on the side of not going there.",

    "description": "Coefficient | Sr. Backend Engineer | Remote From India/North America | Remote Only | coefficient.io\n\n Who we are\nCoefficient is a VC-backed SaaS startup in the SF Bay Area. We are still in stealth and just raised a large seed round. The founders are serial entrepreneurs whose last startup, Shopular, was backed by Y Combinator and Sequoia and acquired by Rakuten Ebates.\n\n What we do\nCoefficient is a self-service data warehouse for business teams. Today's data tools and BI stacks were designed for data specialists and data engineers. However, as more companies and business functions embrace data-driven cultures, they are held back by the inherit complexity of existing data analytics tools, as well as the technical expertise required to set up, maintain, and operate full BI stacks. Coefficient's mission is to unlock organizations' latent data productivity, by enabling users to model, re-shape, and build reports using data from any data source—all within an intuitive, no-code interface.\n\n Who you are\nWe are looking for a lead backend engineer to help us shape and deliver our vision. You will work alongside the founders to define product, design core backend architecture, and develop resilient, scalable systems from the ground up. You have 7+ years of experience designing and building complex backend systems\nYou have extensive Python experience. More details: https://angel.co/company/coefficient-io/jobs",

We are still in stealth and just raised a large seed round. The founders are serial entrepreneurs whose last startup, Shopular, was backed by Y Combinator and Sequoia and acquired by Rakuten Ebates.<p><i></i> What we do\nCoefficient is a self-service data warehouse for business teams. Today&#x27;s data tools and BI stacks were designed for data specialists and data engineers. However, as more companies and business functions embrace data-driven cultures, they are held back by the inherit complexity of existing data analytics tools, as well as the technical expertise required to set up, maintain, and operate full BI stacks. Coefficient&#x27;s mission is to unlock organizations&#x27; latent data productivity, by enabling users to model, re-shape, and build reports using data from any data source—all within an intuitive, no-code interface.<p><i></i> Who you are\nWe are looking for a lead backend engineer to help us shape and deliver our vision. You will work alongside the founders to define product, design core backend architecture, and develop resilient, scalable systems from the ground up. You have 7+ years of experience designing and building complex backend systems\nYou have extensive Python experience.
