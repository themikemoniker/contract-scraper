Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/stripe\">Stripe</a> to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.</p><h3><strong>About the team</strong></h3><p>You’ll join Customer Advocacy and Programs team, a small, high-impact team inside Customer Success, that amplifies the voice of the customer and turns feedback into measurable change. We synthesize customer input across touchpoints to surface the highest‑value opportunities, then partner with Product, GTM, Support, Operations, and more to turn those opportunities into strategy, deliverables, and lasting improvements. We also provide rapid, expert support for the most critical user situations — helping account teams to distill complex problems, develop issue triage repeatability through process and playbooks, and build a point of view on best practices. Our mission is to ensure <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/stripe\">Stripe</a>’s most strategic customers get maximum value from their <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/stripe\">Stripe</a> investments.</p><h3><strong>What you’ll do</strong></h3><p>The User Health Strategist role exists to accelerate resolution of high‑risk, high‑visibility user escalations and to build repeatable processes and playbooks that reduce recurrence. You’ll operate at the intersection of customer advocacy, operations, and cross‑functional coordination: evaluating escalations, designing resolution plans, mobilizing internal resources, and coaching account teams. When appropriate, you’ll act as the internal DRI and program manager for complex, multi‑workstream situations. You’ll also help institutionalize learnings by creating post‑mortems, playbooks, and processes that reduce similar escalations.</p><h3><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h3><ul><li>Triage: Conduct deep-dives with account teams to rapidly understand customer issues, assess level of criticality and impact, and clearly distill problems needing to be solved. </li><li>Mobilize: Propose and align the necessary cross‑functional resources required to drive resolution.</li><li>Coach and Manage: Advise account teams on resolution plans, operating models, playbooks, and best practices for escalation management. At times, act as program manager/DRI for escalations.</li><li>Codify: Create and maintain escalation playbooks, runbooks, and templates; lead post‑mortems and memorialize lessons to prevent recurrence</li><li>Strategize: Identify systemic patterns across escalations and partner with cross‑functional teams to recommend product, process, or tooling changes.</li></ul><h3><strong>Who you are</strong></h3><p>We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.</p><h3><strong>Minimum requirements</strong></h3><ul><li>4+ years of experience in program management, go-to-market, support, operations, incident/escalation management, or a related discipline</li><li>Proven experience managing complex, multi‑stakeholder projects or escalations end‑to‑end, including coordinating technical and non‑technical teams</li><li>Prior experience with enterprise customers or large accounts and familiarity with executive engagement practices</li><li>Ability to quickly distill complex information to assess risk, prioritize under pressure, and drive resolution with urgency</li><li>Strong problem‑solving and analytical skills with comfort handling incomplete data and uncertainty</li><li>Strong cross‑functional influencing skills and experience working with Product, Engineering, Operations, Support, Go-to-market, and Finance stakeholders</li><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills; experience preparing executive updates and leading cross‑functional meetings</li></ul><h3><strong>Preferred qualifications</strong></h3><ul><li>Experience with SQL or analytics tools to interrogate program and user data</li></ul><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

Our team thrives in an innovation-driven environment where transparency, autonomy, and trust fuel everything we do.</p><p>You may not meet every requirement, and that’s okay. If this role excites you, we’d love you to raise your hand for what could be a truly career-defining opportunity.</p></div><p><strong>This is a remote opportunity and we would be interested in applicants from Canadian time zones only at this time. </strong></p><h3>Senior Software Engineer - Platform InfraCore</h3><h4><strong>The Opportunity: </strong></h4><p><strong>About our Platform:</strong><br>Grafana Cloud moves millions of metrics, log lines, and traces per second from our customers' environments into a highly available, low-latency stack that processes and stores this data, and serves them to dashboards and alerting tools. We aim to grow this to hundreds of millions per second, and it's critical that as we grow, we improve our performance, increase our reliability, and, of course, do it efficiently and effectively.</p><p>The Internal Engineering Platform (IEP) delivered by the Platform group provides application engineers with the tools, systems and Kubernetes clusters they need to build, deploy and run their workloads. Platform roles at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/grafana-labs\">Grafana Labs</a> have an eye for engineers with a passion for performance and reliability, and who enjoy taking projects from conception to production. We organize ourselves into squads to allow focus on: cloud infrastructure and capacity management; security; engineering productivity; monitoring and sustainability; and US Federal compliance.</p><p>Because we deploy production services, we have on-call rotations to ensure the health of the system. Everyone at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/grafana-labs\">Grafana Labs</a> tries to incorporate and use our product line up into their day-to-day, so being on call is an important way to understand our system and how people use our products.</p><h3>What You’ll Be Doing:</h3><p>We are hiring for the Platform InfraCore squad. This squad provides and owns automation of the provisioning of CSP resources, including networking, Kubernetes clusters and specific CSP resources required by our application teams. </p><p>We’re part of a Platform Engineering group that manages infrastructure for the teams that are building some of the most cherished Platform tools - Grafana, Mimir, Loki, Tempo, Pyroscope to name a few.</p><h3>What Makes You a Great Fit:</h3><ul><li>You enjoy working with engineers, as well as with the management structures that are there to support you and enable you and your team to do your very best. </li><li>You are <strong>comfortable working in a remote-first company</strong>; communication is key. For us, working together means being collaborative, friendly, kind, and respectful. We operate by consensus, you can contribute to a discussion but then commit to the team decision.</li><li>As such, being such a highly distributed company, means we would love someone who is keen on working with <strong>distributed systems</strong>, too.</li><li>You are eager to <strong>learn and grow</strong>. There is a lot of room for growth and development, and the team has quite a lot of knowledge to share for those who are wanting to learn. </li><li>You approach development <strong>holistically</strong>. The team owns the full life cycle of our code; from writing design docs, to looking at developer feedback, and integration testing. We appreciate engineers who enjoy looking at the big picture, and also notice the details of the brush strokes. The Platform team mainly works with Go, Python, and Shell.</li><li>You have experience with <strong>operating your code</strong>. Since a lot of operators and developers use our software, having some grounding in both of these spaces really helps us with building better platforms for our users.</li></ul><h3>Requirements:</h3><ul><li>Kubernetes cluster provisioning and lifecycle management.</li><li>Management of cluster networking components: load balancing, NAT, DNS, CNIs, network policies, private connectivity for customers, cross-cluster communication.</li><li>Management of scheduling and autoscaling.</li><li>Maintaining Crossplane compositions and Terraform modules for CSP resources common to our users. As well the management of versioning and compatibility for Crossplane and Terraform core as well as providers.</li><li>Work with our users (Grafana Cloud application teams) to help understand their needs and ensure we’re investing in the right capabilities.</li><li>Participation in the Platform department Infrastructure wing on-call rotation.</li></ul><h3>Bonus Points For:</h3><ul><li>You’ve worked in or on open source, or other community-based projects previously. At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/grafana-labs\">Grafana Labs</a>, “OSS is in our DNA”.</li><li>Experience with a few CSPs. We run Grafana Cloud on AWS, GCP, and Azure using each’s managed Kubernetes service - EKS, GKE, AKS.</li><li>Experience operating and managing workloads on Kubernetes. We use Tanka for configuration management with Jsonnet.</li><li>Familiarity with Kubernetes scheduling and projects like Karpenter.</li><li>Terraform and/or Crossplane experience. We have mixed usage - each has its strengths.</li><li>Enjoys programming in Go. We love building our own tools, utilities, exporters, etc. that suit our needs and otherwise don’t exist (and open sourcing them).</li><li>Likes to think about operational maturity. Find anything particularly interesting about the CNCF Platform Engineering Maturity Model?</li><li>Maybe there’s something missing in this job description that you think you might bring to our table? Feel free to let us know!</li></ul><h3>A few of our upcoming projects:  </h3><ul><li>Improving K8s efficiency. Considerations include processor architecture, CSP capacity, machine selection, multi-AZ utilization.</li><li>K8s cluster lifecycle automation. Grafana Cloud regions are mapped to CSP regions - we already utilize many and plan to utilize many more. We’re always maturing our approach to operating at an increasingly greater scale.</li><li>Terraform ease of use. Mentioned above is Terraform and Crossplane. Our Crossplane delivery strategy is strong! As is our Terraform delivery, but we have a bit of work to do to get it where we want it to be for ourselves and our internal users.</li></ul><h3>Compensation &amp; Rewards:</h3><p>In Canada, the Base compensation range for this role is CAD 164,490- CAD 197,389.
