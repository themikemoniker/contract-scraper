Our team is composed of cancer survivors, clinicians, and experts in cutting-edge healthcare delivery. We believe that world class care after a cancer diagnosis shouldn’t end when treatment is over, and we provide an innovative, evidence-based approach to deliver patient-centered, whole-person support for survivors throughout the cancer journey.</p><p>Our vision is a world where living beyond cancer isn’t just “surviving”—it’s thriving.</p><p>A few tidbits about cancer survivorship: </p><ul><li>There are over 18 million cancer survivors in the United States today—and that number is expected to grow to 26 million by 2040</li><li>Cancer survivors experience a range of physical and mental health side effects from treatment </li><li>Survivorship starts at the moment of diagnosis and continues post-treatment—we are starting in the “transitions of care” phase post-treatment, when there is often not a specialized team to take over caring for the survivor moving forward</li></ul><h3>Our Guiding Principles:</h3><ul><li><strong>By survivors, for survivors:</strong> We build the survivor voice and experience into all that we do</li><li><strong>Clinical integrity and rigor: </strong>We prioritize evidence-based approaches and an integrated team to deliver the highest-quality care</li><li><strong>Trauma-informed care: </strong>We “meet survivors where they are” and respect their lived experience</li><li><strong>Changing the status quo: </strong>We are committed to radically reinventing how cancer survivorship care is designed, delivered, and experienced</li><li><strong>Transparency &amp; inclusivity: </strong>Building a new frontier of cancer care is both hard and rewarding—everyone has a role to play, and fostering a positive and open team culture is our priority</li></ul></div><h3>About the Role:</h3><p>At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/oncoverycare\">OncoveryCare</a>, we deeply understand the impact of cancer on a patient’s physical and mental health, and we are dedicated to supporting our patients with trauma-informed and evidence-based care.

To support this, our care team is supported by a robust clinical operations team that assists with admin and billing, custom tools to streamline care delivery and documentation, and consultation from clinical leadership. Additionally, you will have access to vetted referral partners and community resources to facilitate seamless transitions of care for your patients.

      "description": "<h3>About CoLab</h3><p>At CoLab, we want to help mechanical engineering teams bring life-changing products to market years sooner.</p><p>CoLab is a cloud based platform for engineering design review. We make it easy for subject matter experts (SMEs) across your business to access, evaluate, and comment on 2D drawings and 3D models. Our built-in AI peer checker, AutoReview, scans designs for common errors or non-compliance with your standards and guidelines. AutoReview creates markups and comments on your files, in context – just like a human checker.</p><p>With CoLab, human SMEs and AI work together to help you make better decisions and improve designs faster. We automatically capture knowledge from across your global business that would otherwise be buried in emails, spreadsheets, slide decks, and unknown locations in Sharepoint or PLM. Then, we make sure every lesson learned and every design guideline is applied exactly when it matters.</p><p>Companies like Johnson Controls, Komatsu, Schaeffler, and Polaris have launched products 40% faster, cut BOM costs by 50%, and reduced quality escapes by 15% in 1 year.</p><h3>About the Role</h3><p>CoLab is hiring a Visualization Technical Support Specialist to take ownership of our most common and most complex category of customer support: 3D viewing. In this role, you'll lead initial investigation and resolution of customer-reported issues related to our visualization stack—triaging and solving support cases where possible, and escalating to our internal viewing team or 3rd party software integrator when needed.</p><p>This is first and foremost a support role. You'll be the point of contact on customer-facing technical issues, but we’re looking for someone who’s also interested in the development side—able to run a local dev environment, comfortable debugging SDK-level issues, and potentially contributing bug fixes over time.</p><p>Most of our incoming tickets are related to our Viewer function. Today, our dev team gets pulled in too early and too often. You’ll help us fix that—owning the triage process, reducing unnecessary escalations, and ensuring customer issues are handled with clarity, accountability, and speed.</p><h3>Our Ideal Candidate</h3><p>You’re the kind of person who can read between the lines of a support ticket and understand what’s really going on. You’re not afraid to dive into technical tools, run your own local environment and deal with nebulous problem sets. You’re also a clear, thoughtful communicator—able to manage external relationships, handle customer calls when needed, and document issues with precision. You’ll thrive in this role if you’re comfortable working in the messy middle between support, development, and vendor technology. This role requires someone who enjoys solving complex problems—even when root causes aren’t obvious. If you have an engineering mindset this could be the right role for you. </p><h3>What You’ll Do</h3><ul><li>Own the initial investigation and resolution of CAD/HOOPS/3D viewing-related customer support issues.</li><li>Determine when and how to escalate issues to CoLab’s Viewing team or our 3rd party vendor—reducing unnecessary escalations through deeper front-line troubleshooting.</li><li>Manage the full communication flow with external vendors, including vendor escalations and tracking follow-ups to resolution.</li><li>Run and manage a full local development environment to replicate and diagnose issues.</li><li>Prepare internal documentation, summaries, and root cause reports that clearly identify what happened, why, and what needs to change.</li><li>Provide general technical support coverage during vacations or absences on the broader support team.</li><li>Occasionally meet directly with customers (virtually) to review or troubleshoot viewing issues.</li></ul><h3>Qualifications</h3><h3>Must-Have Experience</h3><ul><li>3+ years in a technical support or developer support role, ideally in a B2B software environment.</li><li>Experience working with 3D viewing technologies and CAD</li><li>Experience communicating with external vendors or technology partners </li><li>Ability to run and debug a local development environment.</li><li>Excellent written communication and documentation skills; able to write clear, structured analysis of technical issues and outcomes.</li><li>Strong troubleshooting and problem-solving skills, particularly in ambiguous or multi-system issues.</li></ul><h3>Nice-to-Have Experience</h3><ul><li>Familiarity with FreeCAD or other open-source CAD tools.</li><li>Experience with NX or Creo support environments.</li><li>Experience working with HOOPS.</li><li>Knowledge of 3D web technologies, such as Three.js, WebGL, or vector shading.</li><li>Background in CAD data formats and visualization pipelines.</li></ul><h3>Extra Details</h3><p>Compensation: This is a full-time, permanent role with a competitive salary and stock options package.</p><p>Benefits: Extended health coverage, unlimited paid vacation, and RRSP matching.</p><h3>Location: Remote in Canada </h3><h3>Equity Note</h3><p>Frequently cited statistics show that people who identify with historically marginalized groups are likely to apply to jobs only if they meet 100% of the qualifications. We encourage you to help us break that statistic and apply even if you don’t meet every single qualification—your potential is what matters most to us.</p><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

That is where you would come in, essentially acting as a fractional CTO.</p><p>The role is challenging because you essentially would be interacting with the business people (most often the founders) and try to rein them in, protect the dev team, focus the needs of the business and translate them to the dev team. Sometimes they have a product manager, but not always, and you may need to partially fill that role (and we can have a business analyst and/or a UX designer assist you).</p><p>Ideally, you would act as a fractional CTO for 2 to 3 companies (working between 30 to 50 hours per month per company) with the remaining time collaborating with our architect team on improving <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/arcanys\">Arcanys</a>’ internal functions (hiring, training, internal applications).</p><h3>We might also need your help with:</h3><ul><li><p>Meeting an occasional founder / investment opportunity in person</p></li><li><p>Doing a technical code audit of a potential new investment</p></li><li><p>Consult on other projects regarding specific expertise you may have</p></li></ul><h3>What are the required skills/conditions?</h3><h3>Non-negotiables</h3><ul><li><p>Must be an expert in Microsoft C# .NET or Nodejs.</p></li><li><p>Mastery of React (Angular or Vue are nice to have).</p></li><li><p>Experience with Ionic &amp; React Native would be a plus.</p></li><li><p>Other interesting languages covered in a minority of our projects: Python, Java</p></li></ul><h3>Other requirements</h3><ul><li><p>Minimum 15 years working experience in software development</p></li><li><p>Extensive RDBMS experience, such as MySQL, MsSQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL</p></li><li><p>Solid experience with Azure and AWS, good knowledge of DevOps is a plus</p></li><li><p>Nice to haves would be any of these, for the rare project: Python, Kotlin, iOS Swift, Java (enterprise), Golang</p></li></ul><p><strong>What are the responsibilities?<br>It may be some of these, but not necessarily all of them:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Interact with product owners to improve and translate requirements into realistic features</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Review software architecture and system design regularly</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Handle frequent code reviews and coach developers</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Perform code audits in potential client projects or investments</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Handle ad-hoc complex matters (e.g. coding, DevOps, etc).</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Help <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/arcanys\">Arcanys</a> with the continuous improvement and development of its teams</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>As part of the architect team, help <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/arcanys\">Arcanys</a> with the continuous improvement and development of its teamsParticipate in occasional recruitment activities (exam reviews and interviews)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Handle occasional research on the newest frameworks and technologies to help improve <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/arcanys\">Arcanys</a> training plans</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>As a company focused on its people's satisfaction first (and clients’ in close second), we make a point to offer exciting work opportunities and foster a culture to which everyone can meaningfully contribute.</strong></p><p><strong>All of this wrapped into great care for employees' welfare, recently ranked #25 on Fortune's 100 Best Companies to work in Southeast Asia, GreatPlaceToWork certified, Glassdoor ratings of 4.8/5, and Clutch Ratings of 5/5.</strong></p><h3><strong>Working conditions:</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Mostly remote, with the occasional in person client meeting.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Flexible working schedule.

      "description": "<h3>ABOUT TRADEBYTE</h3><p>At Tradebyte, we work with the biggest players in e-commerce - from trendsetting fashion brands to major online retailers. Our goal is to create a workplace where everyone feels valued, supported, and empowered.</p><p>We offer flexible work schedules, professional development opportunities, and a real commitment to work-life balance. We embrace diverse perspectives and ensure that every voice is heard and respected, because you’re unique and that matters to us.</p><p>As we continue to grow, we’re looking for new colleagues who share our passion. Love what you do - do what you love. Join Tradebyte, an independent company within the <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/zalando\">Zalando</a> Group!</p><h3>Note from the CTO</h3><h3>Hello,</h3><p>I’m the CTO at Tradebyte - and I really like my job 🙂. We are the silent engine powering the global fashion and lifestyle industry. If you’ve bought a sneaker or a luxury bag online recently, there’s a good chance our middleware made that transaction happen. We are a market leader, we are experts, and we are growing fast. That’s why I’m hiring for a (Senior) Executive Project Manager in my team.</p><h3>THE ROLE AND THE TEAM</h3><p><b>The Reality of Scaling.</b> We are a market leader and we’re growing fast. But with that growth comes complexity. The CTO’s focus is on our long-term technology vision and product strategy, while the operational reality of our scaling organization requires dedicated leadership in alignment, process, and communication.</p><p><b>That’s where you come in.</b>We are looking for a strategic partner. Someone who understands that \"delivery\" isn't just about ticking boxes—it's about driving value. We need a leader who can navigate the space between high-level strategy and deep-dive execution.</p><p>We are not looking for a purely administrative project manager. We are looking for a<b> (</b><b>Senior) Executive Project Manager</b> who can act as a connector and a catalyst. You will ensure that while we dream big, we also execute with precision.</p><p>If you want a role where you can shape how a product and engineering organization operates—and you are eager to guide decisions through to successful outcomes—we want to hear from you.</p><h3>The Mission: How you’ll make an impact</h3><p>You won’t just be ‘managing projects’. You’ll facilitate the rhythm of the Product and Engineering organization.</p><ul><li><p><b>Connect the dots.</b> You’ll bridge the gap between the Management Board’s vision and operational execution. Working closely with the Head of Staff, you will ensure the CTO’s strategic roadmap acts as the blueprint for Product and Engineering delivery.</p></li><li><p><b>Strategic Representation.</b>You’ll represent Product &amp; Tech leadership in critical forums. You are empowered to make decisions within your scope and provide the necessary insights to keep the CTO and leadership team aligned.</p></li><li><p><b>Program Governance &amp; Orchestration. </b>We deal with massive marketplace integrations (<a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/zalando\">Zalando</a>, Amazon, AboutYou). You’ll lead high-stakes, cross-functional initiatives that span the entire Product and Engineering organisation, as well as Customer Success.</p></li><li><p><b>Operational Excellence. </b>You’ll identify systemic bottlenecks and evolve processes to enable flow. From refining Agile methodologies to overseeing resource allocation and budget planning, you will build the ecosystem that allows our product teams to thrive.</p></li><li><p><b>Translation &amp; Communication. </b>You’re comfortable translating between ‘Business’ and ‘Tech.’ You will turn strategic intent into actionable roadmaps, ensuring clarity and transparency across the organization.</p></li></ul><h3>The Mindset: Who we are looking for</h3><ul><li><p><b>You understand SaaS &amp; Middleware.</b> You navigate the API economy. You know what it means to build high-availability systems in the fashion/lifestyle space where seasonality (hello, Black Friday) requires calm, focused preparation.</p></li><li><p><b>High EQ &amp; Conviction.</b>You know how to build consensus with stakeholders who don’t report to you. You’re empathetic and a proactive listener, comfortable offering a different perspective to leadership when it supports the best interest of the company.</p></li><li><p><b>Bringing clarity.</b>You thrive in environments that are 80% structured and 20% ‘figure it out’. You bring order to ambiguity without creating bureaucracy.</p></li><li><p><b>Strategic connector.</b>You understand organisational dynamics and know how to leverage your relationships to get things moving.</p></li><li><p><b>Experience.</b> Significant experience (5-7+ years) in Strategic Operations, Technical Program/Project Management, or a Chief of Staff capacity within a high-growth SaaS or Tech environment.</p></li></ul><h3>Why Join The Team</h3><ul><li><p><b>Visibility &amp; Influence.</b> You won’t be buried in the org chart. You work directly with the CTO, the Head of Staff, and the VP level, giving you a comprehensive view of how a market-leading SaaS creates value.</p></li><li><p><b>Tangible impact.</b>The initiatives you drive will directly affect millions of transactions and thousands of brands. You’ll see the tangible results of your work immediately.</p></li><li><p><b>The culture.</b>We’re deep in the Fashion &amp; Lifestyle space. We value aesthetics, speed, and creativity, but we’re engineers at heart. We believe the best idea wins, regardless of who it comes from.</p></li><li><p><b>Growth.</b> This role is a career accelerator. Whether you aim to eventually become a VP of Engineering, a Head of Product, or a Founder—this position gives you the strategic toolkit and the network to get there.</p></li></ul><h3>Ready to Build?</h3><p>If the job description above resonates with you don’t just send us a generic cover letter. Tell us about a time you took a failing project and turned it around, or how you managed a stakeholder who was impossible to please. Let’s build the future of fashion commerce together!</p><h3><b><b>OUR OFFER</b></b></h3><p>Tradebyte provides a range of benefits, here’s an overview of what you can expect. Ask your Talent Acquisition Partner to learn more about what we offer.</p><ul><li><h3>Employee shares program</h3></li><li><p>40% off fashion and beauty products sold and shipped by <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/zalando\">Zalando</a>, 30% off Lounge by <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/zalando\">Zalando</a>, discounts from external partners</p></li><li><h3>2 paid volunteering days a year</h3></li><li><p>Hybrid working model - work where it works for you within Germany or the UK, with regular office attendance required for moments that matter. </p></li><li><p>Work from abroad for up to 30 working days a year</p></li><li><p>27 days of vacation a year to start for full-time employees</p></li><li><p>Relocation assistance available (subject to prior agreement)</p></li><li><p>Family services, including counseling and support</p></li><li><p>Health and wellbeing options (including Wellhub, formerly Gympass)</p></li><li><p>Mental health support and coaching available</p></li><li><p>Drive your development with our training offerings and biannual peer-to-peer review</p></li></ul><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",
