At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/soulchi\">SOULCHI</a>, we are driven by a vision that blends virtues-based leadership, conscious growth, and a commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. As an equity-based startup team member, you're not just joining a team; you're embarking on a journey to shape a more harmonious and sustainable world. We believe that true progress stems from the fusion of innovation and values, and that's exactly what you'll find here – a dynamic environment where your talents will thrive, your ideas will flourish, and your impact will resonate far beyond. Join us in rewriting the narrative of leadership and making a lasting difference that echoes through generations. </p><h3>Role Overview: </h3><p>We are seeking a Senior NLP Engineer to help implement a language model-based solution for an innovative application. The role involves working with machine learning models, managing cloud infrastructure, and optimizing API integrations to deliver a scalable and effective user experience. The candidate will contribute to the development and fine-tuning of the model to ensure high performance and cost-efficiency.</p><h3>Responsibilities:</h3><ul><li>Fine-tune and optimize      large language models to improve user interactions.</li><li>Implement and maintain      API integrations for seamless communication with the model.</li><li>Optimize model training      processes to reduce time and cost.</li><li>Manage and monitor cloud      infrastructure (Google Cloud Platform) for compute and storage needs.</li><li>Collaborate with      stakeholders to refine user experience and system performance.</li></ul><p><strong>Requirements</strong>:</p><ul><li>Strong experience with      machine learning models and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).</li><li>Proficiency with cloud      platforms, particularly Google Cloud (Vertex AI, cloud compute, storage).</li><li>Knowledge of AI/ML tools      and frameworks, especially in natural language processing (NLP).</li><li>Familiarity with API      integrations and cloud resource management.</li><li>Strong problem-solving      skills and the ability to work independently.</li><li>Effective communication      skills for technical and non-technical team collaboration.</li><li>Past experience building personalized AI systems would be helpful.</li><li>Familiarity with cost optimization strategies for cloud-based AI services is a plus.</li></ul><h3>Equity-Based Compensation Opportunity:  </h3><p>As part of the <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/soulchi\">SOULCHI</a> team, you'll take part in our equity-based compensation model, aligning your success with the success of our business. After much research we have found the fairest equity model for a startup. We use the Slicing Pie model.  First phase is equity-based only, which we are currently in. Equity calculations move dynamically based on your fair market rate and actual number of hours worked.  In the second phase, which happens at the break-even point, the equity freezes at each member's current earned percentage and compensation switches to salary + benefits. Your equity percentage gets paid out annually as part of the profit sharing. This is more than a job; it's an opportunity to own a piece of the future. </p><p>We request you only apply for this position if you believe an equity-based model is the perfect fit for you.  A more detailed explanation from the professor who created the model can be found on Youtube, '<strong>Pie Slicer Equity Split Software</strong>' by <em>Slicing Pie</em>. </p><p>We understand the importance of work-life balance and recognize that each individual has unique scheduling needs. As such, we offer flexibility in working hours for the Full-Stack Developer role, with the opportunity to work anywhere between 15 to 40 hours per week, depending on the candidate's availability and suitability for the role. </p><p>Thank you for considering <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/soulchi\">SOULCHI</a> as your future employer. </p><p><strong>How to Apply: </strong>To apply, please submit your resume and a cover letter detailing your alignment with our mission and the value you can bring to our team. Join our passionate team and be part of a transformative journey to spread virtues, create social impact, and contribute to a more loving and peaceful world. Together, we can harness the power of technology to bring the truth of oneness to the center of societies worldwide.</p></div><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

Equity calculations move dynamically based on your fair market rate and actual number of hours worked. In the second phase, which happens at the break-even point, the equity freezes at each member's current earned percentage, and compensation switches to salary + benefits. Your equity percentage gets paid out annually as part of the profit sharing. This is more than a job; it's an opportunity to own a piece of the future.</p><p>We request you only apply for this position if you believe an equity-based model is the perfect fit for you. A more detailed explanation from the professor who created the model can be found on Youtube, \"<strong>Pie Slicer Equity Split Software</strong>\" by <em>Slicing Pie</em>.<a data-faitracker-click-bind=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bjT71MAF2s\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p><p>We understand the importance of work-life balance and recognize that each individual has unique scheduling needs. As such, we offer flexibility in working hours for the Head of Business Development (Equity-Based) role, with the opportunity to work anywhere between 15 to 40 hours per week, depending on the candidate's availability and suitability for the role.</p><p><strong>Flexible Work Hours:</strong><br>We understand the importance of work-life balance and offer flexibility in working hours for the Head of Business Development role. You may work anywhere from 15 to 40 hours per week, depending on your availability and fit for the role.</p><p><strong>Why Join <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/soulchi\">SOULCHI</a>:</strong><br>This is an incredible opportunity to play an integral role in a transformative company.
