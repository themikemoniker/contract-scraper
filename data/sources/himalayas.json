      "description": "<h3><strong>Om <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/nova-psykiatri\">Nova Psykiatri</a></strong><p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/nova-psykiatri\">Nova Psykiatri</a> grundades med en vision om att revolutionera psykiatrin och behandling av psykiska ohälsa. Vi strävar efter att erbjuda en modern och patientcentrerad vårdupplevelse. Vi vill erbjuda bästa Europas bästa utredning och behandling för personer med ADHD, Autism och annan psykiatrisk problematik.</p><p>Dagens psykiatri präglas av traditionella metoder och ett ofta långsamt arbetssätt, där tekniska framsteg och patientens behov sällan står i fokus. Många patienter har svårt att navigera i ett komplext offentligt system eller vänder sig till stora vårdgivare där de riskerar att bli en anonym siffra i mängden. Vi har valt att göra saker annorlunda genom att sätta patienten i centrum och erbjuda psykiatrisk vård med en femstjärnig service. Vår strategi bygger på patientupplevelse, kvalitet och effektivitet, där vi använder modern teknik och innovativa arbetsmetoder för att ständigt förbättra och utveckla vår verksamhet.</p><p>Vårt engagerade team är kärnan i vår verksamhet och består främst av psykologer, läkare och sjuksköterskor. <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/nova-psykiatri\">Nova Psykiatri</a> grundades i januari 2024 och har idag cirka 30 medarbetare – och vi växer snabbt. Nu söker vi fler drivna personer som vill vara med och forma framtidens psykiatri tillsammans med oss. Vi lägger mycket fokus på att anställa Sveriges duktigaste medarbetare, men även att folk ska trivas bättre här än någon annanstans. <br><br>Novas vision är att visa hur psykiatri kan fungera, för såväl patienter som för medarbetare. Vi tror det går att göra mycket bättre. Vi drivs av att hela tiden förbättra patientnöjdheten, hålla hög kvalitet, och samtidigt höja effektiviteten genom minskad administration. Vi tror att vi når allt detta genom att ha kul tillsammans, våga göra misstag, samt genom att våga sträva mot att vara bäst på det vi gör.</p></h3><h3><strong>Om rollen</strong></h3><p>Vi är ett företag i tillväxt med ett fortlöpande behov av att rekrytera fler duktiga koordinatorer på deltid (8-20 timmar i veckan) som vill bidra till en förstklassig patientupplevelse. Går att arbeta på distans från valfri plats i Sverige.</p><h3>Exempel på arbetsuppgifter:</h3><ul><li>Ansvara för att boka in patienter på tider för utredningar och medicinering.</li><li>Besvara patienter via telefon, mail och chatt.</li><li>Ha dialog med övriga delar av organisationen för att identifiera behov och utvecklingsmöjligheter inom administrationsområdet.</li></ul><p>Stor del av arbetet sker alltså i samtal med andra via telefon. Du kan även komma att arbeta med uppgifter som remisshantering, uppföljning av patientbokningar och stöd i administrativa rutiner samt att bidra till att våra processer blir ännu smidigare.</p><h3><strong>Vem vi söker</strong></h3><p>Vi söker dig som har följande egenskaper:</p><p><em>- Social och serviceinriktad:</em> Du är väldigt duktig på att snabbt bygga tillit med andra och få andra att tycka om dig, då du spelar en central roll i att bemöta patienter och samarbetspartners via telefon samt mejl. Du drivs av att göra det lilla extra för att göra alla du pratar med positiva och nöjda.</p><p><em>- Driven:</em> Du gillar att hålla ett högt tempo och få saker gjort snabbt.</p><p><em>- Strukturerad:</em> Du är duktig på att planera och skapa struktur med en god förmåga att hantera flera uppgifter samtidigt. <br><br>Tidigare erfarenhet är inget krav – vi tror på rätt person med rätt inställning. Om du har tidigare erfarenhet tror vi det kan vara fördelaktigt med erfarenhet inom sälj eller service.</p><h3>Vad vi erbjuder</h3><ul><li>Ett roligt och meningsfullt arbete där du är med och skapar framtidens psykiatri.</li><li>Du är med och skapar förutsättningarna för Sveriges bästa arbetsplats!</li><li>Möjlighet att arbeta i en dynamisk och innovativ miljö.</li><li>En öppen och inkluderande arbetskultur där vi tycker om att ha roligt tillsammans på och utanför jobbet.<br><br><br>Skicka gärna in din ansökan – vi hör av oss om vi ser en möjlighet som matchar din profil!</li></ul><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

Equity calculations move dynamically based on your fair market rate and actual number of hours worked. In the second phase, which happens at the break-even point, the equity freezes at each member's current earned percentage, and compensation switches to salary + benefits. Your equity percentage gets paid out annually as part of the profit sharing. This is more than a job; it's an opportunity to own a piece of the future.</p><p>We request you only apply for this position if you believe an equity-based model is the perfect fit for you. A more detailed explanation from the professor who created the model can be found on Youtube, \"<strong>Pie Slicer Equity Split Software</strong>\" by <em>Slicing Pie</em>.<a data-faitracker-click-bind=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bjT71MAF2s\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p><p>We understand the importance of work-life balance and recognize that each individual has unique scheduling needs. As such, we offer flexibility in working hours for the Chief Operations Officer role, with the opportunity to work anywhere between 15 to 40 hours per week, depending on the candidate's availability and suitability for the role.</p><p>Thank you for considering <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/soulchi\">SOULCHI</a> as your future employer.</p><p><strong>How to Apply: </strong>To apply, please submit your resume and a cover letter detailing your alignment with our mission and the value you can bring to our team. Join our passionate team and be part of a transformative journey to spread virtues, create social impact, and contribute to a more loving and peaceful world. Together, we can harness the power of technology to bring the truth of oneness to the center of societies worldwide.</p></div><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",
