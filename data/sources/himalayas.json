      "description": "<h3><strong><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> is at a breakthrough moment.</strong></h3><p>We are revolutionizing the game animation industry with products rooted in our proprietary AI models, delivering AAA quality character animations to game studios at a fraction of the traditional cost and time. We are scaling rapidly due to early demand from major game studios.</p><p>Combining our proprietary motion capture data with state of the art diffusion models, <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> lets teams generate dynamic, lifelike motion in minutes instead of weeks. We remove one of the biggest bottlenecks in game and cinematic production and empower studios to focus on creativity, iteration and building truly living worlds.</p><h3><strong>The Role</strong></h3><p>You’ll work closely with sales in our expanding commercial department; helping preeminent AAA studios discover new ways of creating animation with <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a>. Working across multiple products simultaneously, you will act as the technical bridge between <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> and the production pipelines of the world’s top game studios.</p><p>We want you to play the role of an animation obsessed “Forward Deployed Engineer”. Rather than just supporting the software, you’ll provide guidance and best practices on how it works in real, complex production environments. You’ll work closely with our Account Executives in a “Sales Pod” setup, helping build technical credibility and trust with customers, and then stay involved to make sure <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> is successfully integrated into their pipeline.</p><p>This role reports into Product, meaning your insights from the field will directly shape the future of animation.</p><h3><strong>What You Will Do</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>The \"Trust Demo\":</strong> Join pre-sales conversations to demonstrate the technical viability of <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> with companies in North America. You will speak the language of Lead Animators and Technical Directors, showing them exactly how <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> fits into their existing rigs and workflows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integration Sprints:</strong> Post-signature, you will lead 2-4 week \"integration sprints.\" You will work hands-on with the customer’s team to install, configure, and optimize <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> within their specific pipeline (Unreal, Unity, Maya, MotionBuilder).</p></li><li><p><strong>Solutions &amp; Support:</strong> Act as the first line of defense for technical hurdles. You won’t just file tickets; you will solve pipeline blockers, advise on retargeting best practices, and help studios blend <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> with their existing animation logic.</p></li><li><p><strong>Product Discovery:</strong> You are the eyes and ears of the Product team. By working deeply with customers, you will identify gaps in our toolset and bring back \"field learnings\" that drive our roadmap.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Who You Are</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Production Experience:</strong> You bring<strong>5+ years i</strong>n the games industry as a Technical Animator, Rigger, or Technical Artist, with a strong grasp of the full animation pipeline from motion capture to engine integration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Industry Authority:</strong> You have walked in our customers’ shoes. You are a former Technical Animator or Lead who understands real production workflows, day to day challenges, and pipeline pain points.</p></li><li><p><strong>Communication:</strong> You pride yourself on your abilities of communication; parsing the meaning behind the words, expressing complex technical concepts simply, and able to teach those who wish to learn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deep Engine Knowledge:</strong> You have expert level proficiency in Unreal Engine, including Motion Matching, Control Rig, State Machines, and Blueprints (Bonus: other engines).</p></li><li><p><strong>DCC Proficiency:</strong> You are highly proficient in Maya and MotionBuilder, with a deep understanding of constraints, IK and FK systems, and retargeting logic.</p></li><li><p><strong>Problem Solving Mindset:</strong> You enjoy debugging a broken rig or a failed import just as much as crafting great animation. You take pride in untangling complex technical issues.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adaptability:</strong> You switch contexts easily. One moment you are explaining diffusion models to a CTO, the next you are helping a junior animator fix a bone hierarchy in Maya.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>This would make you a particularly good match:</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Commercial Aptitude:</strong> While this is a technical role, you understand the business value of efficiency and can help the Account Executive articulate the ROI of our platform during the pre-sales process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Educator Mindset</strong>: you will be teaching a lot. Teaching our customers the <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> best practices and teaching <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a>ns deep insights into the industry.</p></li><li><p><strong>AAA Studio Experience</strong>: you’ve done your best work inside notable AAA studios</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Why Join Us?</strong></h3><p>If you excel in this role, you will find no shortage of opportunities to grow with us. As we scale globally, you will have the path to build a regional team of Technical Animators around you. You will work directly with the most creative teams in gaming, see the impact of your work immediately, and help define a new era of generative animation..</p><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

This role is intentionally broad and flexible - designed for someone who enjoys building from zero, operating in ambiguity, and wearing multiple hats.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is not a pure administrative role. While you will handle coordination, logistics, and follow-through, you will also play an active role in building local networks, engaging recruiters and partners, supporting early team formation, and ensuring momentum across A1’s US launch.</p><h3>What You Will Be Doing</h3><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Partner directly with the CEO on A1’s US setup and launch priorities, including preparation, follow-ups, and execution of key decisions.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Help establish the A1 US office from scratch, covering basic operational setup, vendor coordination, documentation, and local administrative workflows.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Build and maintain a local network of recruiters, hiring partners, and service providers to support early-stage hiring for A1.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Support early hiring efforts by coordinating interviews, managing logistics, and working closely with internal talent teams and external recruiters.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Act as a central execution point across HR, Finance, Operations, and Product teams to keep A1’s US launch activities aligned and on track.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Prepare briefing notes, summaries, and materials for meetings, pitches, and discussions related to hiring, partnerships, and business setup.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Handle ad-hoc requests, last-minute changes, and urgent execution needs with speed, flexibility, and sound judgment.</p></li></ul><h3>What You Will Need</h3><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Experience in startup operations, executive support, business operations, office setup, or generalist roles in fast-moving environments.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Strong organisational skills and the ability to manage multiple workstreams in an unstructured, early-stage setting.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Comfort working closely with senior leadership and handling sensitive, high-context information.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Strong communication skills and confidence engaging external parties such as recruiters, vendors, and partners.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A hands-on, proactive mindset—you are comfortable figuring things out without a playbook.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Willingness to take on a mix of operational, coordination, and business-facing responsibilities as needed.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>(Background is flexible. What matters most is execution ability, judgment, and the willingness to build from zero.)</em></p><h3><strong>How We Work</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our organization is very flat and our team is small, highly motivated, and focused on engineering and product excellence. All members are expected to be hands-on and to contribute directly to the company’s mission.</p><h3><strong>Interview process</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If there appears to be a fit, we'll reach to schedule 3, but no more than 4 interviews.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Applications are evaluated by our technical team members.

If you've demonstrated the exceptional skills and mindset we're looking for, we'll extend an offer to join us.

      "description": "<p><strong>About CoLab</strong><br><br>At CoLab, we want to help mechanical engineering teams bring life-changing products to market years sooner.<br>CoLab is a cloud based platform for engineering design review. We make it easy for subject matter experts (SMEs) across your business to access, evaluate, and comment on 2D drawings and 3D models. Our built-in AI peer checker, AutoReview, scans designs for common errors or non-compliance with your standards and guidelines. AutoReview creates markups and comments on your files, in context – just like a human checker.<br>With CoLab, human SMEs and AI work together to help you make better decisions and improve designs faster. We automatically capture knowledge from across your global business that would otherwise be buried in emails, spreadsheets, slide decks, and unknown locations in Sharepoint or PLM. Then, we make sure every lesson learned and every design guideline is applied exactly when it matters.<br>Companies like Johnson Controls, Komatsu, Schaeffler, and Polaris have launched products 40% faster, cut BOM costs by 50%, and reduced quality escapes by 15% in 1 year.</p><h3>About the Role</h3><p>As a Senior Product Manager on the Build Viewing team at CoLab, you’ll own one of the most critical and technically challenging parts of our platform, our viewing technologies. <br>This team is responsible for everything related to rendering and interacting with 2D drawings and 3D CAD models inside CoLab. That includes file loading performance, markup tools, measurement features, and how we integrate and extend our underlying HOOPS SDK. You’ll help define what gets built, why it matters, and how we balance immediate customer needs with long-term product goals.</p><p>Although you sit within the product organization, you’ll be fully embedded in the Viewing build team—a close-knit group of engineers with deep technical expertise. Your job is to bring structure and strategic direction to the team, while acting as the connective tissue between customer problems, technical tradeoffs, and product outcomes.<br>This is a high-impact role with broad ownership across UX, infrastructure, and partner relationships. If you have experience working on complex visualization tools or CAD systems—and want to shape how engineering teams around the world interact with their designs—this could be your next role.</p><h3>Our Ideal Candidate</h3><ul><li>You’re a seasoned PM with a strong technical foundation—ideally in mechanical engineering, CAD, or 3D systems.</li><li>You’ve worked closely with developers on complex product areas, and you’re confident leading through ambiguity.</li><li>You’re fluent in customer pain, technical tradeoffs, and product storytelling.</li></ul><h3>You’ll thrive in this role if:</h3><ul><li>You’ve shipped features in a deeply technical product area—especially one involving 3D viewers, graphics pipelines, or performance optimization.</li><li>You can lead high-trust conversations with engineers, designers, and customer-facing teams.</li><li>You’re curious about how mechanical engineers work and passionate about building tools that make their lives easier.</li></ul><h3>What You’ll Do</h3><ul><li> Own and evolve the product strategy and roadmap for the CoLab Viewer.</li><li>Work day-to-day with the Viewing engineering team to ship performant, reliable, and high-impact features.</li><li>Guide how we handle complex technical tradeoffs—especially around SDK usage, file formats, rendering logic, and scalability.</li><li>Conduct deep user research with mechanical engineers and support teams to uncover pain points and prioritize solutions.</li><li>Write clear, concise product requirements that help the team understand what to build and why it matters.</li><li>Work in tandem with a designer, technical lead and team to plan and deliver value to our customers.</li><li>Partner with 3rd party vendor escalations, evaluate integration opportunities, and drive viewer stability.</li><li>Define success metrics and use data to validate hypotheses, track performance, and drive continuous improvement.</li></ul><h3>What You’ll Need</h3><ul><li>5+ years of product management experience, ideally in B2B SaaS or technical product environments</li><li>Strong technical foundation,<strong> ideally with a background in mechanical engineering or 3D visualization tools</strong></li><li>Proven success managing complex infrastructure or platform areas in a software product</li><li>Experience collaborating directly with senior engineers, TPMs, and external vendors</li><li>Strong written and verbal communication skills—especially when explaining tradeoffs or aligning stakeholders</li></ul><p><strong>The Extra Details</strong><br>Compensation: This is a full-time, permanent position with a competitive compensation package that includes stock options.<br>Benefits: Extended health and benefits package, including unlimited paid vacation and 5% RRSP matching.<br>Remote/Hybrid Work: Our main office is in St. John’s, NL, with hybrid and remote work options. This role can be done from anywhere in Canada.</p><p><strong>Equity Note</strong><br>Frequently cited statistics show that people who identify with historically marginalized groups are likely to apply to jobs only if they meet 100% of the qualifications. We encourage you to help us break that statistic and apply even if you don’t meet every single qualification—your potential is what matters most to us.</p><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

Geen dag is hetzelfde en je draagt bij aan iets belangrijks: Iedere dag 1 miljard liter drinkwater van topkwaliteit winnen, zuiveren en leveren. Elke druppel telt!</p><h3>Waar jij mee aan de slag gaat</h3><p style=\"margin:0.0cm 0.0cm 8.0pt;line-height:115%;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Aptos, sans-serif\">Als Procescontroller bestaat je verantwoordelijkheid uit twee hoofdtaken.  </p><p style=\"margin:0.0cm 0.0cm 8.0pt;line-height:115%;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Aptos, sans-serif\">Ten eerste ben je verantwoordelijk voor het productieproces op de locaties binnen jouw gebied, op die manier dat zowel de kwaliteit als kwantiteit op orde zijn. Je richt je op procesoptimalisatie aan de hand van beschikbare data en treft indien nodig corrigerende maatregelen. Ook ben je verantwoordelijk voor het productieproces ten aanzien van de reststoffen en de efficiency van het proces ten aanzien van chemicaliën- en energieverbruik.</p><p style=\"margin:0.0cm 0.0cm 8.0pt;line-height:115%;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Aptos, sans-serif\">Ten tweede draag je verantwoording voor de dagelijkse waterverdeling in jouw gebied. Hierbij handel je proactief bij voorziene en onvoorziene afwijkingen. Bij dit werk zijn er vier hoofdzaken te onderscheiden: dagdiensten, consignatiediensten, productieproces op locaties en deelname aan projecten op locaties vanuit de procescontrollerrol. In veel gevallen komt daar na verloop van tijd een specialistische rol bij.</p><p style=\"margin:0.0cm 0.0cm 8.0pt;line-height:115%;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Aptos, sans-serif\">Dit alles doe je voor een groot deel vanachter de computer. Daarnaast voer je ook een deel van werkzaamheden uit ‘in het veld’. Je denkt continu na over hoe de dingen beter, veiliger, zuiniger en duurzamer kunnen. Om dit goed te kunnen doen ben je veel in overleg met je collega’s van de afdeling Bedrijfsvoering, maar ook met bijvoorbeeld Onderhoudstechnici, Engineers en Specialisten van verschillende afdelingen.</p><h3>Concrete taken zijn:</h3><ul style=\"margin-top:0.0cm;margin-bottom:0.0cm\" type=\"disc\"><li style=\"margin-top:0.0cm;margin-right:0.0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;line-height:115%;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:verdana, geneva, sans-serif\">Geautomatiseerde systemen bedienen en monitoren om de kwaliteit te garanderen;</li><li style=\"margin-top:0.0cm;margin-right:0.0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;line-height:115%;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:verdana, geneva, sans-serif\">Proactief handelen bij afwijkingen, zodat je storingen voorkomt of opheft;</li><li style=\"margin-top:0.0cm;margin-right:0.0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;line-height:115%;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:verdana, geneva, sans-serif\">Optimaliseren van gebruik van chemicaliën en energie, voor een duurzame procesgang;</li><li style=\"margin-top:0.0cm;margin-right:0.0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;line-height:115%;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:verdana, geneva, sans-serif\">Deelnemen aan multidisciplinaire projecten op de locaties (winning en zuivering);</li><li style=\"margin-top:0.0cm;margin-right:0.0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;line-height:115%;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:verdana, geneva, sans-serif\">Continu meedenken over verbeteringen, innovaties voorstellen en (helpen) uitvoeren.  </li></ul><p style=\"margin:0.0cm 0.0cm 8.0pt;line-height:115%;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Aptos, sans-serif\">Als Procescontroller versterk jij het team Bedrijfsvoering.

Dit betekent niet dat je per se moet zijn opgeleid tot Technicus. Je signaleert weliswaar storingen en probeert zelfstandig uit te zoeken waar het probleem zit - je hebt dus zeker basiskennis nodig van de technische installaties - maar je hoeft de storingen niet zelf op te lossen.</p><p style=\"margin:0.0cm 0.0cm 8.0pt;line-height:115%;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Aptos, sans-serif\">Jouw werk gaat over informatie verzamelen en interpreteren, doordachte en goed onderbouwde beslissingen nemen, samenwerken en communiceren.

This is an execution-focused role, ideal for someone who enjoys turning clear direction into finished work, balancing multiple priorities, and learning new tools quickly. While this position is not strategy-based, it does require strong executional judgment and increasing ownership as the role is mastered.</p><p>Success in this role depends on consistent follow-through, close attention to detail, and comfort working through feedback and revisions. The right candidate takes pride in completing work accurately and on time, communicates proactively, and, once fully ramped, is able to own assigned projects from intake through completion, keeping work moving forward and representing the team professionally in client-facing interactions without the need for constant oversight.</p><h3>Role Responsibilities</h3><p>In this role, you will support the creation and execution of client marketing materials across multiple channels, including client launches and onboarding initiatives.

This work involves coordinating assets across teams, maintaining organized files and version control, and assisting with reporting, documentation, and internal coordination. Strong organization and attention to detail are essential to keeping work streamlined and accessible.</p><p>Clear communication and collaboration are central to this role. You will interact regularly with internal stakeholders, ask thoughtful questions when direction is unclear, confirm expectations, and take ownership of assigned tasks while working as part of a team.</p><h3>Desired Skills &amp; Qualities</h3><p>• Highly organized, dependable, and deadline-driven</p><p>• Strong time-management skills with the ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously</p><p>• Foundational creative skill set with an understanding of core design principles (layout, hierarchy, spacing, color, and visual balance)</p><p>• Working knowledge of Adobe Creative Suite, particularly Photoshop and InDesign</p><p>• Ability to produce clean, professional visual work while following established brand guidelines</p><p>• Sound visual judgment when creating or updating marketing materials</p><p>• Comfortable taking direction, executing work consistently, and applying feedback and revisions accurately</p><h3>• Quick to learn new tools and systems</h3><p>• Solid writing skills for internal and external communication</p><p>• Strong sense of ownership and accountability from assignment through completion</p><p>• Prior experience supporting social media or marketing teams is helpful</p><p>• Backgrounds in creative fields, education, communications, or program coordination are beneficial</p><p>• Candidates with strong creative fundamentals, high attention to detail, and a willingness to continue developing technical design skills are encouraged to apply</p><h3>Portfolio / Work-Sample Requirement</h3><h3>Work Samples (Preferred)</h3><p>Applicants are asked to submit 3–6 examples of creative work that demonstrate foundational design skills and attention to detail. Samples may include visual graphics, social media assets, layouts, or other marketing or creative materials. Work created using Canva, Adobe Photoshop, or similar tools is encouraged.</p><p>We are not seeking senior-level design portfolios. Instead, we are looking for evidence of clean execution, visual judgment, and the ability to follow brand or style guidelines. Coursework, academic projects, or professional examples are all welcome, provided the work reflects the candidate’s individual contribution.</p><p>As part of the interview process, shortlisted candidates will have to complete a short Photoshop exercise to assess role-relevant design skills.</p><p>The exercise is limited in scope and intended to support interview discussions and evaluation.</p><h3>Benefits</h3><p>Our benefits are all aimed at supporting a healthy work-life balance and cultivating a company culture where you can bring your whole, human self to work.</p><h3>Here's what we offer:</h3><ul><li>🌴Paid time off</li><li>📄401(k) plan</li><li>🩺Medical insurance </li><li>🦷Dental insurance</li><li>👁️Vision insurance</li><li>➕Life insurance </li><li>💰Company-wide bonus scheme</li></ul><p><em>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds, experiences and identities to apply.

      "description": "<h3>The Organization: <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/merit-america\">Merit America</a></h3><p>The American economy is broken. Today, 53 million working adults–nearly half of the U.S. workforce–do not earn a living wage. These talented workers have few options to advance: college is too long and expensive, full-time boot camp programs don’t offer enough flexibility, and online courses don’t have the structure or support to translate learning into a new career. The result? Talented workers, disproportionately people of color and women, get stuck in low-wage roles with no way to build a better life for themselves and their families.</p><p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/merit-america\">Merit America</a> is a national nonprofit that creates pathways to family-sustaining careers for Americans stuck in low-wage work. Our fast, flexible solutions are built for working adults: We start by analyzing tens of millions of job postings to identify in-demand, high-paying tech careers. We then work with industry-recognized partners to train for these roles with part-time programs that combine flexible online learning with best-in-class coaching. Finally, we support our learners in their job search, helping them connect with a broad constellation of local and national employers such as JPMorgan Chase and Infosys to land higher-earning, family-sustaining jobs, driving an average wage gain of $24k three months or more after completing the program. <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/merit-america\">Merit America</a> is on a mission to build a scalable pathway for workers to join the middle class through merit, not money.

      "description": "<h3><strong><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> is at a breakthrough moment.</strong></h3><p>We are revolutionizing the game animation industry with products rooted in our proprietary AI models, delivering AAA quality character animations to game studios at a fraction of the traditional cost and time. We are scaling rapidly due to early demand from major game studios.</p><p>Combining our proprietary motion capture data with state of the art diffusion models, <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> lets teams generate dynamic, lifelike motion in minutes instead of weeks. We remove one of the biggest bottlenecks in game and cinematic production and empower studios to focus on creativity, iteration and building truly living worlds.</p><h3><strong>The Role</strong></h3><p>You’ll work closely with sales in our expanding commercial department; helping preeminent AAA studios discover new ways of creating animation with <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a>. Working across multiple products simultaneously, you will act as the technical bridge between <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> and the production pipelines of the world’s top game studios.</p><p>We want you to play the role of an animation obsessed “Forward Deployed Engineer”. Rather than just supporting the software, you’ll provide guidance and best practices on how it works in real, complex production environments. You’ll work closely with our Account Executives in a “Sales Pod” setup, helping build technical credibility and trust with customers, and then stay involved to make sure <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> is successfully integrated into their pipeline.</p><p>This role reports into Product, meaning your insights from the field will directly shape the future of animation.</p><h3><strong>What You Will Do</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>The \"Trust Demo\":</strong> Join pre-sales conversations to demonstrate the technical viability of <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> with companies in North America. You will speak the language of Lead Animators and Technical Directors, showing them exactly how <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> fits into their existing rigs and workflows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integration Sprints:</strong> Post-signature, you will lead 2-4 week \"integration sprints.\" You will work hands-on with the customer’s team to install, configure, and optimize <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> within their specific pipeline (Unreal, Unity, Maya, MotionBuilder).</p></li><li><p><strong>Solutions &amp; Support:</strong> Act as the first line of defense for technical hurdles. You won’t just file tickets; you will solve pipeline blockers, advise on retargeting best practices, and help studios blend <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> with their existing animation logic.</p></li><li><p><strong>Product Discovery:</strong> You are the eyes and ears of the Product team. By working deeply with customers, you will identify gaps in our toolset and bring back \"field learnings\" that drive our roadmap.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Who You Are</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Production Experience:</strong> You bring<strong>5+ years i</strong>n the games industry as a Technical Animator, Rigger, or Technical Artist, with a strong grasp of the full animation pipeline from motion capture to engine integration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Industry Authority:</strong> You have walked in our customers’ shoes. You are a former Technical Animator or Lead who understands real production workflows, day to day challenges, and pipeline pain points.</p></li><li><p><strong>Communication:</strong> You pride yourself on your abilities of communication; parsing the meaning behind the words, expressing complex technical concepts simply, and able to teach those who wish to learn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deep Engine Knowledge:</strong> You have expert level proficiency in Unreal Engine, including Motion Matching, Control Rig, State Machines, and Blueprints (Bonus: other engines).</p></li><li><p><strong>DCC Proficiency:</strong> You are highly proficient in Maya and MotionBuilder, with a deep understanding of constraints, IK and FK systems, and retargeting logic.</p></li><li><p><strong>Problem Solving Mindset:</strong> You enjoy debugging a broken rig or a failed import just as much as crafting great animation. You take pride in untangling complex technical issues.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adaptability:</strong> You switch contexts easily. One moment you are explaining diffusion models to a CTO, the next you are helping a junior animator fix a bone hierarchy in Maya.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>This would make you a particularly good match:</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Commercial Aptitude:</strong> While this is a technical role, you understand the business value of efficiency and can help the Account Executive articulate the ROI of our platform during the pre-sales process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Educator Mindset</strong>: you will be teaching a lot. Teaching our customers the <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> best practices and teaching <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a>ns deep insights into the industry.</p></li><li><p><strong>AAA Studio Experience</strong>: you’ve done your best work inside notable AAA studios</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Why Join Us?</strong></h3><p>If you excel in this role, you will find no shortage of opportunities to grow with us. As we scale globally, you will have the path to build a regional team of Technical Animators around you. You will work directly with the most creative teams in gaming, see the impact of your work immediately, and help define a new era of generative animation..</p><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

This role is intentionally broad and flexible - designed for someone who enjoys building from zero, operating in ambiguity, and wearing multiple hats.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is not a pure administrative role. While you will handle coordination, logistics, and follow-through, you will also play an active role in building local networks, engaging recruiters and partners, supporting early team formation, and ensuring momentum across A1’s US launch.</p><h3>What You Will Be Doing</h3><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Partner directly with the CEO on A1’s US setup and launch priorities, including preparation, follow-ups, and execution of key decisions.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Help establish the A1 US office from scratch, covering basic operational setup, vendor coordination, documentation, and local administrative workflows.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Build and maintain a local network of recruiters, hiring partners, and service providers to support early-stage hiring for A1.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Support early hiring efforts by coordinating interviews, managing logistics, and working closely with internal talent teams and external recruiters.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Act as a central execution point across HR, Finance, Operations, and Product teams to keep A1’s US launch activities aligned and on track.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Prepare briefing notes, summaries, and materials for meetings, pitches, and discussions related to hiring, partnerships, and business setup.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Handle ad-hoc requests, last-minute changes, and urgent execution needs with speed, flexibility, and sound judgment.</p></li></ul><h3>What You Will Need</h3><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Experience in startup operations, executive support, business operations, office setup, or generalist roles in fast-moving environments.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Strong organisational skills and the ability to manage multiple workstreams in an unstructured, early-stage setting.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Comfort working closely with senior leadership and handling sensitive, high-context information.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Strong communication skills and confidence engaging external parties such as recruiters, vendors, and partners.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A hands-on, proactive mindset—you are comfortable figuring things out without a playbook.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Willingness to take on a mix of operational, coordination, and business-facing responsibilities as needed.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>(Background is flexible. What matters most is execution ability, judgment, and the willingness to build from zero.)</em></p><h3><strong>How We Work</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our organization is very flat and our team is small, highly motivated, and focused on engineering and product excellence. All members are expected to be hands-on and to contribute directly to the company’s mission.</p><h3><strong>Interview process</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If there appears to be a fit, we'll reach to schedule 3, but no more than 4 interviews.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Applications are evaluated by our technical team members. Interviews will be conducted via virtual meetings and/or onsite.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We value transparency and efficiency, so expect a prompt decision. If you've demonstrated the exceptional skills and mindset we're looking for, we'll extend an offer to join us. This isn't just a job offer; it's an invitation to be part of a team that's bringing AI to have practical benefits to billions globally.</p><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

      "description": "<h3><strong><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> is at a breakthrough moment.</strong></h3><p>We are revolutionizing the game animation industry with products rooted in our proprietary AI models, delivering AAA quality character animations to game studios at a fraction of the traditional cost and time. We are scaling rapidly due to early demand from major game studios.</p><p>Combining our proprietary motion capture data with state of the art diffusion models, <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> lets teams generate dynamic, lifelike motion in minutes instead of weeks. We remove one of the biggest bottlenecks in game and cinematic production and empower studios to focus on creativity, iteration and building truly living worlds.</p><h3><strong>The Role</strong></h3><p>You’ll work closely with sales in our expanding commercial department; helping preeminent AAA studios discover new ways of creating animation with <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a>. Working across multiple products simultaneously, you will act as the technical bridge between <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> and the production pipelines of the world’s top game studios.</p><p>We want you to play the role of an animation obsessed “Forward Deployed Engineer”. Rather than just supporting the software, you’ll provide guidance and best practices on how it works in real, complex production environments. You’ll work closely with our Account Executives in a “Sales Pod” setup, helping build technical credibility and trust with customers, and then stay involved to make sure <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> is successfully integrated into their pipeline.</p><p>This role reports into Product, meaning your insights from the field will directly shape the future of animation.</p><h3><strong>What You Will Do</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>The \"Trust Demo\":</strong> Join pre-sales conversations to demonstrate the technical viability of <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> with companies in North America. You will speak the language of Lead Animators and Technical Directors, showing them exactly how <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> fits into their existing rigs and workflows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integration Sprints:</strong> Post-signature, you will lead 2-4 week \"integration sprints.\" You will work hands-on with the customer’s team to install, configure, and optimize <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> within their specific pipeline (Unreal, Unity, Maya, MotionBuilder).</p></li><li><p><strong>Solutions &amp; Support:</strong> Act as the first line of defense for technical hurdles. You won’t just file tickets; you will solve pipeline blockers, advise on retargeting best practices, and help studios blend <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> with their existing animation logic.</p></li><li><p><strong>Product Discovery:</strong> You are the eyes and ears of the Product team. By working deeply with customers, you will identify gaps in our toolset and bring back \"field learnings\" that drive our roadmap.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Who You Are</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Production Experience:</strong> You bring<strong>5+ years i</strong>n the games industry as a Technical Animator, Rigger, or Technical Artist, with a strong grasp of the full animation pipeline from motion capture to engine integration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Industry Authority:</strong> You have walked in our customers’ shoes. You are a former Technical Animator or Lead who understands real production workflows, day to day challenges, and pipeline pain points.</p></li><li><p><strong>Communication:</strong> You pride yourself on your abilities of communication; parsing the meaning behind the words, expressing complex technical concepts simply, and able to teach those who wish to learn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deep Engine Knowledge:</strong> You have expert level proficiency in Unreal Engine, including Motion Matching, Control Rig, State Machines, and Blueprints (Bonus: other engines).</p></li><li><p><strong>DCC Proficiency:</strong> You are highly proficient in Maya and MotionBuilder, with a deep understanding of constraints, IK and FK systems, and retargeting logic.</p></li><li><p><strong>Problem Solving Mindset:</strong> You enjoy debugging a broken rig or a failed import just as much as crafting great animation. You take pride in untangling complex technical issues.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adaptability:</strong> You switch contexts easily. One moment you are explaining diffusion models to a CTO, the next you are helping a junior animator fix a bone hierarchy in Maya.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>This would make you a particularly good match:</strong></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Commercial Aptitude:</strong> While this is a technical role, you understand the business value of efficiency and can help the Account Executive articulate the ROI of our platform during the pre-sales process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Educator Mindset</strong>: you will be teaching a lot. Teaching our customers the <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a> best practices and teaching <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/motorica\">Motorica</a>ns deep insights into the industry.</p></li><li><p><strong>AAA Studio Experience</strong>: you’ve done your best work inside notable AAA studios</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Why Join Us?</strong></h3><p>If you excel in this role, you will find no shortage of opportunities to grow with us. As we scale globally, you will have the path to build a regional team of Technical Animators around you. You will work directly with the most creative teams in gaming, see the impact of your work immediately, and help define a new era of generative animation..</p><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

This role is intentionally broad and flexible - designed for someone who enjoys building from zero, operating in ambiguity, and wearing multiple hats.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This is not a pure administrative role. While you will handle coordination, logistics, and follow-through, you will also play an active role in building local networks, engaging recruiters and partners, supporting early team formation, and ensuring momentum across A1’s US launch.</p><h3>What You Will Be Doing</h3><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Partner directly with the CEO on A1’s US setup and launch priorities, including preparation, follow-ups, and execution of key decisions.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Help establish the A1 US office from scratch, covering basic operational setup, vendor coordination, documentation, and local administrative workflows.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Build and maintain a local network of recruiters, hiring partners, and service providers to support early-stage hiring for A1.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Support early hiring efforts by coordinating interviews, managing logistics, and working closely with internal talent teams and external recruiters.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Act as a central execution point across HR, Finance, Operations, and Product teams to keep A1’s US launch activities aligned and on track.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Prepare briefing notes, summaries, and materials for meetings, pitches, and discussions related to hiring, partnerships, and business setup.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Handle ad-hoc requests, last-minute changes, and urgent execution needs with speed, flexibility, and sound judgment.</p></li></ul><h3>What You Will Need</h3><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Experience in startup operations, executive support, business operations, office setup, or generalist roles in fast-moving environments.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Strong organisational skills and the ability to manage multiple workstreams in an unstructured, early-stage setting.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Comfort working closely with senior leadership and handling sensitive, high-context information.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Strong communication skills and confidence engaging external parties such as recruiters, vendors, and partners.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">A hands-on, proactive mindset—you are comfortable figuring things out without a playbook.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Willingness to take on a mix of operational, coordination, and business-facing responsibilities as needed.</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>(Background is flexible. What matters most is execution ability, judgment, and the willingness to build from zero.)</em></p><h3><strong>How We Work</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Our organization is very flat and our team is small, highly motivated, and focused on engineering and product excellence. All members are expected to be hands-on and to contribute directly to the company’s mission.</p><h3><strong>Interview process</strong></h3><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If there appears to be a fit, we'll reach to schedule 3, but no more than 4 interviews.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Applications are evaluated by our technical team members. Interviews will be conducted via virtual meetings and/or onsite.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">We value transparency and efficiency, so expect a prompt decision. If you've demonstrated the exceptional skills and mindset we're looking for, we'll extend an offer to join us. This isn't just a job offer; it's an invitation to be part of a team that's bringing AI to have practical benefits to billions globally.</p><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

Backed by artificial intelligence and machine learning, <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/jerry\">Jerry</a>.ai simplifies and automates owning and maintaining a car while providing personalized services for all car owners' needs. We spend every day innovating and improving our AI-powered app to provide the best possible experience for our customers. We are the #1 rated and most downloaded app in our category with a 4.7 star rating in the App Store. We have more than 5 million customers — and we’re just getting started.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">With significant progress across various aspects of our product, we are prioritizing customer acquisition and profitable growth as our top objectives for the coming years. Our growth team (product &amp; marketing) is directly responsible for <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/jerry\">Jerry</a>.ai’s most critical initiative - achieving high double-digit growth - by driving customer acquisition through strategic and innovative approaches.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">To achieve this, we’re expanding our Growth team and hiring an <strong>Associate Director, Growth Marketing </strong>to drive scalable customer acquisition through paid marketing. You will begin by owning our <strong>Google portfolio - Search, Demand Gen, UAC, and YouTube</strong> - a set of fast-growing channels where we’ve built meaningful traction in under a year and still have substantial room to scale. As the company grows, you’ll have the opportunity to broaden your channel ownership and expand your influence, shaping your own path at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/jerry\">Jerry</a>.ai.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">This role offers substantial career growth opportunities, resources, and CEO visibility. You will work directly with the VP of Growth (Product &amp; Marketing) and the executive team to build, optimize, and scale high-impact growth initiatives. Initially, this position is a hands-on individual contributor role with the potential to transition into a leadership role as we scale.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">If you’re looking for a unique challenge in a high-impact role with uncapped potential and an opportunity to work with some of the most talented leaders in tech, we’d love to hear from you!</p><h3>How you will make impact:</h3><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Phase 1:</strong> In this hands-on phase, your focus will be on finding and implementing successful strategies to make our channels cost-effective. This period will last 12 - 30 months, depending on the speed and effectiveness of the changes you implement. Example responsibilities include:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Lead and own channel performance from end to end, including strategy, execution, analysis, optimization, with the support from data team, product team, and agency partners</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Analyze and monitor campaign performance, identify trends, and make optimizations to drive improvement; react to deviations from plans quickly and strategically</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Conceive and execute innovative experiments; deliver and apply data-driven, analytically rigorous insights and recommendations to enhance performance.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Allocate and manage budget for each campaign to maximize ROAS</p></li></ul></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Once successful strategies are identified, the next phase involves scaling those strategies. This will likely require building a team and transitioning into a leadership role, orchestrating the efforts rather than managing them directly. Example responsibilities include:</p><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Strategize the full-funnel marketing road map to achieve long-term exponential growth</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Lead new channel expansion with innovation, thoughtfulness and rigor</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Expand the growth team with exceptional talented junior marketers</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Who you are:</h3><ul style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">3+ years of experience in digital performance marketing, including 2+ years of hands-on ownership of paid search and google channels (campaign set up, experimentation, bidding, creative testing, and measurement)</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">2+ years of strategic consulting background (ideally MBB or equivalent), with demonstrated ability to structure complex problems, prioritize and communicate clearly</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Strong quantitative analytical ability working with full-funnel metrics (CAC, LTV, ROAS, incrementality) and a knack for storytelling through data</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Proven ability to <strong>design and execute experiments</strong> end to end: forming hypotheses, defining success metrics, running tests, interpreting results, and scaling what works.</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Deep technical acumen of paid growth ecosystem</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ability to thrive in an ambiguous and fast-paced environment</p></li><li><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">Ownership mentality - you are not satisfied with “good enough”</p></li></ul><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em>While we appreciate your interest and application, only applicants under consideration will be contacted.</em></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><em><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/jerry\">Jerry</a>.ai is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer.
