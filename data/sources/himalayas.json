We’re a lean, high-impact team tackling some of the world’s most critical challenges, ranging from human trafficking and financial fraud to terrorist financing. We are builders who power governments, financial institutions, and crypto companies when the clock is running and the consequences are real. This is why every TRMer is a bet on our future and has the power to change our trajectory.</p></div><p>The Security Team is responsible for and committed to securing all things at TRM. From our customers to our code, and everything in between, the security team is involved in all aspects of the business. We are looking for a Senior Compliance Engineer to own TRM’s compliance and GRC initiatives that ensure we continue to deliver best-in-class security and trust for our customers.</p><ul class=\"p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet\" data-stringify-type=\"unordered-list\" data-indent=\"0\" data-border=\"0\"><li data-stringify-indent=\"0\" data-stringify-border=\"0\"><h3>The impact you will have here:</h3><ul><li>Develop scalable and sustainable processes and tools for normalized controls, collecting audit evidence, monitoring controls, and conducting gap analyses.</li><li>Manage TRM’s existing security compliance and certification lifecycle (e.g., SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001/27701, FedRAMP, CMMC) while planning for and prioritizing future compliance needs.</li><li>Operationalize the GRC program to maintain our regulatory certifications.</li><li>Manage customer due diligence requests including developing and maintaining security collateral for customers (e.g., SIG, CAIQ).</li><li>Conduct enterprise risk assessments and manage the risk registry.</li><li>Develop a vendor risk management program.</li><li>Identify areas for improvement based on input from customers, the go-to-market teams, and overall business objectives. Anticipate customer needs with respect to compliance and due diligence.</li></ul><h3>What we’re looking for:</h3><ul><li>Develop automation to programmatically implement controls validations and evidence collections. Experience with Python or other programming and scripting languages is required.</li><li>Work to align advanced technologies and Privacy by Design principles from the first stages of development and ensure that the data use meets established regulatory compliance needs.</li><li>Strong understanding of Public Sector compliance security standards including NIST 800-53, SOC 2, CMMC, ISO, CyberEssentials UK, and other common compliance frameworks.</li><li>Experience with leading a cloud-first SaaS company through the audit procesess.</li><li>Strong focus on normalizing controls across frameworks and standards, with an eye toward improving maturity, scalability, and consistency over time, while looking beyond just “checking the box”.</li><li>Privacy and GDPR experience is a plus.</li><li>Security certifications (e.g., CISSP, CISM) are a plus.</li></ul><h3>Team Characteristics:</h3><ul><li>Remote first, globally distributed team</li><li>Strong ownership and accountability</li><li>Strong technical expertise, previous software development background preferred</li><li>Open, honest, and timely information sharing</li><li>Willingness to help each other succeed</li><li>Healthy debate without personal conflict</li><li>Shared problem-solving</li></ul></li></ul><h3>About the Team</h3><ul><li>The culture of our team is built on mutual respect, where everyone's opinion is valued and heard.</li><li>We prioritize flexibility and efficiency, always seeking smarter ways to work without compromising quality.</li><li>Transparency is at the heart of how we operate, both within the team and with the business, as we focus on clearly communicating and addressing cyber risks.</li><li>Our collaborative approach ensures that we not only mitigate these risks but also align our efforts with business goals to protect and drive success.</li></ul><h3>Time Zones:</h3><ul><li>Eastern Standard Time (EST - GMT-4)</li><li>Pacific Standard Time (PST - GMT-7)</li><li>Central European Summer Time (CET - GMT+2)</li></ul><h3>Learn about TRM Speed in this position:</h3><ul><li>Automate Repetitive Compliance Checks - Manually verifying compliance across systems or reviewing logs can be time-intensive.

At TRM, we build and leverage automation and API's to pull real-time compliance data from critical systems into a centralized GRC tool or dashboard.</li><li>Shift Left in Compliance - Detecting non-compliance late in a project lifecycle often requires rework and delays. At TRM, we embed compliance checks early in the development lifecycle.

      "description": "<h3>Description/Responsibilities</h3><p>The Vice President of Market Strategy and Commercialization is a senior leadership role reporting to the Chief Strategic Development Officer. This leader will be responsible for accelerating business velocity to reach our ambitious growth goals by leading and rotating across various top strategic priority areas over time. As a commercial operator and strategic builder, the VP of Market Strategy and Commercialization will combine deep market insights, hands-on go-to-market testing and refining, and end-to-end operating models to drive growth in unproven or emerging business lines. The role operates at the intersection of strategy and execution – acting as an internal “evangelist” to translate strategic opportunities into tangible commercial success across the organization.</p><p>The ideal candidate is a strategic thinker with strong business acumen and an entrepreneurial mindset, capable of driving strategy through execution in ambiguous, fast-paced environments. This leader should have a background as an operator or P&amp;L leader, with a proven ability to lead cross-functional teams and deliver results on high-impact projects. This leader must be an exceptional communicator, able to influence at all levels and foster collaboration across departments. Just as importantly, the VP of Market Strategy and Commercialization should be aligned with our mission and passionate about wellness and healthcare, bringing a commitment to building solutions that empower people to lead healthier lives.</p><h3>Primary responsibilities:</h3><ul><li>Accountability for Emerging Business Lines or New Market Opportunities: Identify, launch, and drive key strategic priority markets that accelerate revenue growth and expand our impact. Operate as the business owner for these priority areas, from initial concept through full execution by serving as the central accountable figure – owning the strategy and P&amp;L for these ventures to ensure they meet short-term and long-term performance goals. Think broadly about what the business line may need to be successful (e.g., internal resources, external partnerships), make the business case and ensure successful execution. </li><li>Market Insight &amp; Business Design: Gather and synthesize market research, customer insights, and competitive intelligence to inform strategic decisions. Leverage these insights to shape product direction, service design, and value propositions for new offerings and accelerate product market fit.</li><li>Cross-Functional Leadership &amp; Operational Readiness: Oversee cross-functional execution of initiatives by partnering closely with Product, Operations, Sales, Marketing, and other teams. Ensure alignment of priorities and coordinate efforts so that new initiatives move smoothly from concept to scale, taking into account the full end-to-end operating model (from B2B marketing materials to client reporting and sunsetting). Influence organizational decisions with limited direct control. </li><li>Product Collaboration: Work hand-in-hand with Product Management and the Chief Product Officer to align the product roadmap with strategic market opportunities. Bring market-driven perspective to product development and utilize escalation paths when necessary to remove roadblocks or adjust priorities in support of growth initiatives.</li><li>Go-to-Market Partnership: Collaborate with Sales, Client Management and Marketing teams to execute go-to-market strategies for new products or services. Support early customer acquisition by developing compelling messaging and value propositions and by engaging directly with key clients or partners as needed. </li><li>Performance Management: Establish clear KPIs and success metrics for each initiative (e.g. learning velocity, user engagement, revenue growth, profitability). Monitor performance against these metrics and proactively adjust strategies to ensure initiatives are on track to meet both short-term milestones and long-term business objectives.</li><li>Executive Communication: Serve as a strategic advisor to the executive leadership team regarding new growth initiatives. Provide regular updates, share insights and learnings, and make data-driven recommendations. Ensure stakeholders are informed, aligned, and excited about the strategic direction.</li></ul><h3>Qualifications</h3><ul><li>Bachelor’s degree in Business, Economics, or a related field is required. MBA preferred. </li><li>10+ years of progressive experience in strategy, product management, general management, or related roles. Demonstrated success in taking new products or business lines from concept to market and scaling them in ambiguous or high-growth environments.</li><li>P&amp;L ownership preferred.</li><li>Experience with go-to-market strategy and market research is preferred.</li><li>Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, including the ability to craft clear executive-level presentations and to inspire teams around a common vision. Comfortable engaging with C-suite leaders, key clients, and external partners.</li><li>Exceptional leadership skills with a track record of influencing and coordinating cross-functional teams (e.g. product, engineering, sales, operations). Able to lead through influence in a matrixed or lean organization, and comfortable making decisions amidst organizational complexity</li><li>Strong analytical and problem-solving capabilities. Data-driven in approach, with the agility to pivot when new insights emerge. Resourceful and resilient, able to navigate uncertainty and adapt strategies on the fly.</li><li>Self-starter with an entrepreneurial spirit. Hands-on and “builder” mentality, willing to roll up your sleeves to get initiatives off the ground. Thrives in environments with a high degree of ambiguity and change.</li><li>A genuine passion for health, wellness, and mission-driven work. Experience in the healthcare, fitness, or wellness industry is a plus, but an unwavering commitment to empowering healthier lifestyles is essential.</li><li>Aligned with our company values and mission. A collaborative team player who can work effectively across departments and is motivated by the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the well-being of our members and communities.</li></ul><p>The salary range for this opportunity is $175,000 to $215,000. Compensation depends on several factors: qualifications, skills, competencies, and experience.</p><p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/tivity-health\">Tivity Health</a> offers a robust benefits package, which includes a competitive salary, company bonus potential, medical, dental, vision, 401k with match, generous paid time off, free gym membership to over 13,000 fitness locations in the US, and other great benefits.</p><h3>7543</h3><p><em>About <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/tivity-health\">Tivity Health</a>® Inc.</em><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/tivity-health\">Tivity Health</a>, Inc. is a leading provider of healthy life-changing solutions, including SilverSneakers®, Prime® Fitness, and WholeHealth Living®.

      "description": "<h3>Description/Responsibilities</h3><p>The Vice President of Market Strategy and Commercialization is a senior leadership role reporting to the Chief Strategic Development Officer. This leader will be responsible for accelerating business velocity to reach our ambitious growth goals by leading and rotating across various top strategic priority areas over time. As a commercial operator and strategic builder, the VP of Market Strategy and Commercialization will combine deep market insights, hands-on go-to-market testing and refining, and end-to-end operating models to drive growth in unproven or emerging business lines. The role operates at the intersection of strategy and execution – acting as an internal “evangelist” to translate strategic opportunities into tangible commercial success across the organization.</p><p>The ideal candidate is a strategic thinker with strong business acumen and an entrepreneurial mindset, capable of driving strategy through execution in ambiguous, fast-paced environments. This leader should have a background as an operator or P&amp;L leader, with a proven ability to lead cross-functional teams and deliver results on high-impact projects. This leader must be an exceptional communicator, able to influence at all levels and foster collaboration across departments. Just as importantly, the VP of Market Strategy and Commercialization should be aligned with our mission and passionate about wellness and healthcare, bringing a commitment to building solutions that empower people to lead healthier lives.</p><h3>Primary responsibilities:</h3><ul><li>Accountability for Emerging Business Lines or New Market Opportunities: Identify, launch, and drive key strategic priority markets that accelerate revenue growth and expand our impact. Operate as the business owner for these priority areas, from initial concept through full execution by serving as the central accountable figure – owning the strategy and P&amp;L for these ventures to ensure they meet short-term and long-term performance goals. Think broadly about what the business line may need to be successful (e.g., internal resources, external partnerships), make the business case and ensure successful execution. </li><li>Market Insight &amp; Business Design: Gather and synthesize market research, customer insights, and competitive intelligence to inform strategic decisions. Leverage these insights to shape product direction, service design, and value propositions for new offerings and accelerate product market fit.</li><li>Cross-Functional Leadership &amp; Operational Readiness: Oversee cross-functional execution of initiatives by partnering closely with Product, Operations, Sales, Marketing, and other teams. Ensure alignment of priorities and coordinate efforts so that new initiatives move smoothly from concept to scale, taking into account the full end-to-end operating model (from B2B marketing materials to client reporting and sunsetting). Influence organizational decisions with limited direct control. </li><li>Product Collaboration: Work hand-in-hand with Product Management and the Chief Product Officer to align the product roadmap with strategic market opportunities. Bring market-driven perspective to product development and utilize escalation paths when necessary to remove roadblocks or adjust priorities in support of growth initiatives.</li><li>Go-to-Market Partnership: Collaborate with Sales, Client Management and Marketing teams to execute go-to-market strategies for new products or services. Support early customer acquisition by developing compelling messaging and value propositions and by engaging directly with key clients or partners as needed. </li><li>Performance Management: Establish clear KPIs and success metrics for each initiative (e.g. learning velocity, user engagement, revenue growth, profitability). Monitor performance against these metrics and proactively adjust strategies to ensure initiatives are on track to meet both short-term milestones and long-term business objectives.</li><li>Executive Communication: Serve as a strategic advisor to the executive leadership team regarding new growth initiatives. Provide regular updates, share insights and learnings, and make data-driven recommendations. Ensure stakeholders are informed, aligned, and excited about the strategic direction.</li></ul><h3>Qualifications</h3><ul><li>Bachelor’s degree in Business, Economics, or a related field is required. MBA preferred. </li><li>10+ years of progressive experience in strategy, product management, general management, or related roles. Demonstrated success in taking new products or business lines from concept to market and scaling them in ambiguous or high-growth environments.</li><li>P&amp;L ownership preferred.</li><li>Experience with go-to-market strategy and market research is preferred.</li><li>Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, including the ability to craft clear executive-level presentations and to inspire teams around a common vision. Comfortable engaging with C-suite leaders, key clients, and external partners.</li><li>Exceptional leadership skills with a track record of influencing and coordinating cross-functional teams (e.g. product, engineering, sales, operations). Able to lead through influence in a matrixed or lean organization, and comfortable making decisions amidst organizational complexity</li><li>Strong analytical and problem-solving capabilities. Data-driven in approach, with the agility to pivot when new insights emerge. Resourceful and resilient, able to navigate uncertainty and adapt strategies on the fly.</li><li>Self-starter with an entrepreneurial spirit. Hands-on and “builder” mentality, willing to roll up your sleeves to get initiatives off the ground. Thrives in environments with a high degree of ambiguity and change.</li><li>A genuine passion for health, wellness, and mission-driven work. Experience in the healthcare, fitness, or wellness industry is a plus, but an unwavering commitment to empowering healthier lifestyles is essential.</li><li>Aligned with our company values and mission. A collaborative team player who can work effectively across departments and is motivated by the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the well-being of our members and communities.</li></ul><p>The salary range for this opportunity is $175,000 to $215,000. Compensation depends on several factors: qualifications, skills, competencies, and experience.</p><p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/tivity-health\">Tivity Health</a> offers a robust benefits package, which includes a competitive salary, company bonus potential, medical, dental, vision, 401k with match, generous paid time off, free gym membership to over 13,000 fitness locations in the US, and other great benefits.</p><h3>7543</h3><p><em>About <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/tivity-health\">Tivity Health</a>® Inc.</em><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/tivity-health\">Tivity Health</a>, Inc. is a leading provider of healthy life-changing solutions, including SilverSneakers®, Prime® Fitness, and WholeHealth Living®.
