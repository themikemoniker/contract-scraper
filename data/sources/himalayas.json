Just like 'Alice' herself, we go down the rabbit hole into the emerging world of AI and focus on safeguarding these technologies. In a world where AI has fundamentally changed the nature of risk, Alice offers coverage across the entire AI lifecycle.</p><p>We're currently on the ground floor of an exciting new initiative: building an \"Elite Collective\" of the world's premier GenAI experts—high-stakes, project-based work for the \"best of the best\" specialists in the industry.</p><p>Work is on-demand and project-dependent, scaling up and down based on the needs of the client. This is not a high-volume, repetitive role; it is an opportunity to be tapped for specific, high-impact interventions when your unique expertise is required.</p><p>The most sophisticated technology challenges in the world are waiting down the rabbit hole. We're looking for the sharpest minds to help us secure the frontier.</p><p>The invitation is open: Come join us at the tea party.</p><h3>About the Position</h3><p>We are seeking versatile GenAI Specialists to join our expert collective. This role encompasses two complementary focus areas—and we're looking for individuals who excel in one or both:</p><h3>Focus Area 1: Adversarial Analysis </h3><p>Design and execute adversarial prompts to identify weaknesses in cutting-edge AI systems, including LLMs, Text-to-Image, Text-to-Video, Multi-Modal models, and AI Agents. Analyze outputs, categorize vulnerabilities, and translate findings into actionable safety insights.</p><h3>Focus Area 2: Creative Prompt Design</h3><p>Craft diverse, context-rich prompts that challenge AI models across policy domains. Blend linguistic creativity with sociocultural insight to simulate realistic, localized use cases - from benign edge cases to sophisticated deception attempts.</p><h3>Key Responsibilities</h3><h3>Adversarial Analysis:</h3><ul><li>Design adversarial prompts to test AI systems across multiple modalities</li><li>Identify, categorize, and document model weaknesses or unsafe outputs</li><li>Support data annotation, curation, and quality control processes</li><li>Summarize findings into structured reports or data templates</li></ul><h3>Creative Prompt Design:</h3><ul><li>Produce high-quality, diverse prompt sets reflecting global linguistic and cultural nuances</li><li>Research online behaviors of threat actors to inform realistic prompt design</li><li>Cover multiple policy areas, such as Hate Speech, Sexual/Graphic Harm, or Terrorism</li><li>Adapt prompts for multiple languages and dialects where applicable</li></ul><h3>Requirements</h3><ul><li>Proven experience with Generative AI models (direct technical experience not required)</li><li>Understanding of risk taxonomies (e.g., harm categories, policy tiers)</li><li>Strong attention to detail and organizational capabilities</li><li>Ability to manage multiple tasks simultaneously and meet deadlines</li><li>Ability to balance creativity with policy sensitivity</li></ul><h3>Language Requirements</h3><p>For Creative Prompt Design focus: We are actively seeking native speakers in the following languages:</p><ul><li><strong>English | Italian | Spanish | German | French | Japanese | Chinese (Mandarin) | Korean | Arabic</strong></li><li>Native-level fluency is essential for crafting culturally authentic, nuanced prompts that reflect real-world linguistic patterns and regional contexts.</li></ul><h3>Preferred Qualifications</h3><ul><li>Strong creative writing background (journalism, fiction, or linguistics)</li><li>Familiarity with various model types (Text-to-Text, Text-to-Image, Text-to-Video)</li><li>Experience with prompt injection techniques, jailbreaks, and red-teaming methodologies</li><li>Prior work in model evaluation, prompt engineering, or safety analysis</li><li>Regional expertise or cultural fluency in specific geopolitical areas</li><li>Proficiency in one or more non-English languages</li></ul><p><strong>All applicants will be required to complete a screening exam and background check.  </strong></p><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

Our mission is to deliver proactive care to one million seniors by 2030. Our technology and clinical care team extend the reach of primary care providers and support patients every day at home.

This hurts both patients (by all too often requiring them to transfer from their home community or miss out on needed care) and the facilities themselves (by hitting their bottom line with the loss of $1000s in patient DRG fees and all ancillary downstream revenues from unnecessary transfers, or with costly and unnecessary readmissions from incorrect diagnoses). </p><p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/amplifymd\">AmplifyMD</a> allows hospitals to bridge the specialty care access gap by solving all the logistical, technical, and legal hurdles to practicing specialty inpatient telemedicine.

Our core mission is to offer a positive, empowering, and transparent property financing experience, simplified from start to finish. We initially started as a digital broker, aiming to make the complex mortgage process more transparent through technology. We quickly evolved to build Canada’s leading online mortgage lending direct-to-consumer platform, where our qualified mortgage experts are supported by advanced technology. </p><p style=\"font-family:\">Since then, we have expanded our offering into a robust \"mortgage ecosystem\" builder, partnering with large financial institutions across Canada. Our first B2B product debuted in 2022 with IG Wealth Management, concurrent with raising a Series C funding round. A critical milestone occurred last year when nesto acquired CMLS Group. This acquisition formed the Nesto Group (under which nesto, CMLS, and its subsidiary brand Intellifi are housed), resulting in a massive increase in scale, with 1,100 employees across 12 offices nationwide and $73 billion CAD in residential and commercial mortgage assets under administration. You will be working on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/nesto-cloud\">Nesto Cloud</a>, Canada’s most advanced cloud platform, delivering end-to-end technology solutions for lenders in the digital age.</p><p style=\"font-family:\"><b><strong style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:10pt;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Why we are hiring</strong></b></p><p style=\"font-family:\">We deliver on our mission by empowering our partners to improve and streamline their mortgage lending operations with the nesto Mortgage Cloud. As Canada's most advanced cloud-based mortgage technology, our SaaS solution offers a best-in-class omnichannel experience. This platform consistently drives volume, boosts productivity, and lowers technology costs. To drive the execution of our upcoming projects, we are growing our Project Management team.</p><p style=\"font-family:\"><b><strong style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:10pt;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Work location, time zone, and availability</strong></b></p><p style=\"font-family:\">We welcome applications from candidates across Canada, with a strong preference for those located in the Eastern Time Zone (EST). While this is a remote-first opportunity with the flexibility to work from home or any of our offices (Montreal, Quebec City, Calgary, Toronto, or Vancouver), the core working hours follow a strict schedule aligned with our client’s 9–5 EST requirements.

All applicants must have authorization to work for <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/click-therapeutics\">Click Therapeutics</a> in the U.S. In certain circumstances it may be advantageous to <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/click-therapeutics\">Click Therapeutics</a> to support the application(s) for temporary visa classification and/or sponsor applications for permanent residence so that a foreign national colleague can accept or remain in a work assignment in the U.

(NYSE: RSG) is a leader in the environmental services industry. We provide customers with the most complete set of products and services, including recycling, waste, special waste, hazardous waste and field services. Our industry-leading commitments to advance circularity and support decarbonization are helping deliver on our vision to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world.</p><p>In 2023, Republic’s total company revenue was $14.9 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 billion. We serve 13 million customers and operate more than 1,000 locations, including collection and transfer stations, recycling and polymer centers, treatment facilities, and landfills.</p><p>Although we operate across North America, the collection, recycling, treatment, or disposal of materials is a local business, and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each market we serve. By combining local operational management with standardized business practices, we drive greater operating efficiencies across the company while maintaining day-to-day operational decisions at the local level, closest to the customer.</p><p>Our customers, including small businesses, major corporations and municipalities, want a partner with the expertise and capabilities to effectively manage their multiple recycling and waste streams. They choose <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/republic-services\">Republic Services</a> because we are committed to exceeding their expectations and helping them achieve their sustainability goals. Our 41,000 team members understand that it's not just what we do that matters, but how we do it.</p><p>Our company values guide our daily actions:</p><ul><li><p><b>Safe</b>: We protect the livelihoods of our colleagues and communities.</p></li><li><p><b>Committed to Serve</b>: We go above and beyond to exceed our customers’ expectations.</p></li><li><p><b>Environmentally Responsible:</b> We take action to improve our environment.</p></li><li><p><b>Driven</b>: We deliver results in the right way.</p></li><li><p><b>Human-Centered:</b> We respect the dignity and unique potential of every person.</p></li></ul><p>We are proud of our high employee engagement score of 86. We have an inclusive and diverse culture where every voice counts. In addition, our team positively impacted 4.6 million people in 2023 through the <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/republic-services\">Republic Services</a> Charitable Foundation and local community grants. These projects are designed to meet the specific needs of the communities we serve, with a focus on building sustainable neighborhoods.   </p><h3>STRATEGY</h3><p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/republic-services\">Republic Services</a>’ strategy is designed to generate profitable growth. Through acquisitions and industry advancements, we safely and sustainably manage our customers’ multiple waste streams through a North American footprint of vertically integrated assets.  </p><p>We focus on three areas of growth to meet the increasing needs of our customers: recycling and waste, environmental solutions and sustainability innovation.</p><p>With our integrated approach, strengthening our position in one area advances other areas of our business. For example, as we grow volume in recycling and waste, we collect additional material to bolster our circularity capabilities. And as we expand environmental solutions, we drive additional opportunities to provide these services to our existing recycling and waste customers.</p><h3>Recycling and Waste</h3><p>We continue to expand our recycling and waste business footprint throughout North America through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. The 13 million customers we serve and our more than 5 million pick-ups per day provide us with a distinct advantage. We aggregate materials at scale, unlocking new opportunities for advanced recycling. In addition, we are cross-selling new products and services to better meet our customers’ specific needs.</p><h3>Environmental Solutions</h3><p>Our comprehensive environmental solutions capabilities help customers safely manage their most technical waste streams. We are expanding both our capabilities and our geographic footprint. We see strong growth opportunities for our offerings, including PFAS remediation, an increasing customer need. </p><h3>SUSTAINABILITY INNOVATION</h3><p>Republic’s recent innovations to advance circularity and decarbonization demonstrate our unique ability to leverage sustainability as a platform for growth.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/republic-services\">Republic Services</a> Polymer Center is the nation’s first integrated plastics recycling facility. This innovative site processes rigid plastics from our recycling centers, producing recycled materials that promote true bottle-to-bottle circularity. We also formed Blue Polymers, a joint venture with Ravago, to develop facilities that will further process plastic material from our Polymer Centers to help meet the growing demand for sustainable packaging. We are building a network of Polymer Centers and Blue Polymer facilities across North America.</p><p>We continue to advance decarbonization at our landfills. As demand for renewable energy continues to grow, we have 70 landfill gas-to-energy projects in operation and plan to expand our portfolio to 115 projects by 2028.</p><h3>RECENT RECOGNITION</h3><ul><li><h3>Barron’s 100 Most Sustainable Companies</h3></li><li><h3>CDP Discloser</h3></li><li><h3>Dow Jones Sustainability Indices</h3></li><li><p>Ethisphere’s World’s Most Ethical Companies</p></li><li><h3>Fortune World’s Most Admired Companies</h3></li><li><h3>Great Place to Work</h3></li><li><h3>Sustainability Yearbook S&amp;P Global</h3></li></ul><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

We serve organizations of all sizes across the UK and US and have an ambitious growth strategy focused on doubling our investments within high-growth partnerships, enterprise customers, and industry verticals. We continue to realise significant demand for our team's specialised services across platform engineering, analytics and AI, and we are seeking to onboard a Sales Director to support this demand. </p><h3>What you will focus on:</h3><p>The Sales Director position is focused on building a sustainable services pipeline within targeted accounts that align with our firm objectives and GTM strategy.  You will work to reactivate dormant Enterprise accounts and break into new accounts within priority verticals, e.g., Insurance, Fintech, Private Equity, Retail, Manufacturing, Logistics, etc. This role will own the end-to-end process of lead sourcing, deal management, and account management (for select accounts). </p><h3>What we are looking for:</h3><p>As a boot-strapped company, everything we do is rooted in operating with \"an entrepreneurial spirit.\" If you enjoy a fast-paced environment and navigating through a quickly evolving market with the autonomy to develop your own path, this is the right role for you. As a firm, we place big bets; sometimes, we fail, but we learn, refine, and work together to keep pushing forward our mission and firm objectives. We seek those who embrace ambiguity and find energy in building new paths of value realisation. Being a \"builder\" and appreciating the chaos while enjoying the rewards is a critical quality/mindset to be successful in this role. </p><p><strong>More specifically, these are the attributes that we are </strong>seeking: </p><ul><li>Enterprise sales experience in consulting and professional services is required. </li><li>High achievers with a track record of meeting/exceeding annual quotas. </li><li>Ability to build and grow executive relationships with prospects and clients; relationship-oriented and going above and beyond for our clients is a must—if they win, you win. </li><li>Ability to build strong relationships with technology partner account executives and sales engineers and to use our technical experts at the right times. </li><li>Ability to operate effectively amid ambiguity through initiative, strategic thought, and grit. </li><li>Team-first mentality is a must. If you are \"in it for yourself,\" you won't be successful at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/aimpoint-digital\">Aimpoint Digital</a>. Regardless of the outcome, we win and lose as a team and support one another. </li><li>General competency and acumen in data, analytics, and AI are required. You must be able to understand and capture an organisation's described needs at a high level, work with our technical leaders to recommend specific service offerings to fulfil, scope and design proposals, and effectively articulate our firm's value proposition. We operate in a market where most competitors are \"racing to the bottom\" to be the cheapest option, but we don't believe that is an effective strategy, nor do we see that it creates the right outcomes for organisations. We are intentional and specific with our value proposition and expect everyone who represents our brand to be able to articulate it effectively. </li></ul><h3>What we have to offer:</h3><ul><li>Highly competitive compensation comprised of base comp, OTE, and equity for high performers. </li><li>A comprehensive benefits package, including: </li><li>An annually increasing pension </li><li>Full healthcare coverage—to prioritise the health and wellbeing of our employees </li><li>EV Salary Sacrifice Car Hire Scheme </li><li>Insurance Policies </li><li>Flexible PTO </li><li>A best-in-market team. Check out our awards and recognition on our website. </li><li>An incredibly collaborative and supportive community; our team comprises the best of the best within their technical fields, but what makes them unique is who they are as humans. We have a team of really good humans. </li></ul><p>We are actively seeking candidates for full-time, hybrid work with weekly in-person expectations in London to meet our technology partners, clients and colleagues in our London Office. The expectation is 60% remote, 40% in-person, but we are incredibly flexible and trust you to manage your time effectively to achieve the best outcomes for all. </p></div><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",
