Our modular, API-first platform helps businesses streamline spending, improve cash flow, and integrate payments into their financial workflows. Designed for industries with complex payment needs, such as travel and fleet, <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/pliant\">Pliant</a> enables greater efficiency, control, and profitability.</p><h3>We serve two primary customer segments:</h3><ul><li>Companies looking to optimize operational processes through intuitive apps and APIs, gaining control, automation, and financial flexibility through extended credit lines.</li><li>Businesses such as financial software platforms, ERP providers, and banks that want to launch or enhance their credit card offerings using <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/pliant\">Pliant</a>’s embedded finance and white-label solutions.</li></ul><p>Founded in 2020 and headquartered in Berlin, <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/pliant\">Pliant</a> supports over 4,000 businesses and more than 20 partners globally. As a licensed e-money institution (EMI), we issue Visa-powered credit cards in 11 currencies across more than 30 countries, helping companies streamline and simplify payments.</p><p>Learn more at<a href=\"http://www.getpliant.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><br>www.getpliant.com</a></p><h3>ABOUT THE ROLE </h3><p>Forget the traditional Support playbook. We aren't looking for people to read scripts or move tickets from one queue to another. We are looking for problem solvers.</p><p>As a Customer Support Specialist, you are the operational backbone of <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/pliant\">Pliant</a>. When a Finance Director or CEO contacts us, they don't want a ticket number - they want a solution so they can get back to running their business. Your job is to provide that peace of mind.</p><p>You will act as the filter for the business, sitting at the intersection of Product, Compliance, and Sales. You won't just answer questions; you will investigate complex financial workflows, unblock technical jams, and ensure that our clients trust us to handle the heavy lifting.</p><h3>WHAT YOU’LL DO </h3><h3>1. Own The Outcome </h3><ul><li>You are the set and forget solution for our clients. When a complex issue lands on your desk - whether it’s a failed transaction or a credit limit urgency - you own it end-to-end. You communicate with clarity and confidence, ensuring the client knows: ‘<a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/pliant\">Pliant</a> is handling it.’ </li><li>Investigate root causes rather than applying quick fixes. You will distinguish between user error and system error and provide feedback to Engineering.</li></ul><h3>2. The Commercial Filter</h3><ul><li>Act as the operational bridge between Compliance and Sales.</li><li>Triage AML/KYC alerts and fraud flags. You will validate data and context before involving the client, ensuring we protect the regulatory license without damaging the commercial relationship.</li><li>You manage the service recovery process for high-value accounts in collaboration with partners across the business (Sales, Product, Risk), ensuring we turn friction into trust.</li></ul><h3>3. Operational Excellence &amp; Knowledge</h3><ul><li>You won't just close tickets or end a call; you will spot friction in our processes and help rewrite the playbook (SOPs) to fix it. You ensure that the global team operates with a single source of truth, raising the standard of service for every interaction.</li><li>You are the first line of defense for Product. When a feature breaks or an integration fails, you are responsible for reproducing the error, documenting the technical steps, and handing a clean bug report to Engineering.</li></ul><p>4. Technical Configuration &amp; Troubleshooting</p><ul><li>Support the specific technical and troubleshooting needs of our specialized verticals (e.g., configuring card types for Travel agencies or setting up spending limits for new entities) to ensure the client’s setup matches their business model.</li><li>You dig deeper than the surface. Whether it's troubleshooting a data sync error with DATEV/Xero or configuring a specific card setup for a Travel agency, you investigate the root cause. You don't just apply a quick fix; you provide feedback to Engineering to ensure it doesn't happen again.</li></ul><h3>WHAT YOU’LL BRING</h3><ul><li>You hate leaving problems unsolved. You thrive in ambiguity and are comfortable saying, \"I don't know, but I will find out.\"</li><li>2+ years of experience in B2B Customer Support, Operations, or Fintech. You are comfortable working in a regulated environment (Fintech/Banking) where details matter and a ticket is actually a relationship.</li><li>You thrive in ambiguity. When you see a broken process, you don't just report it - you suggest a fix. You understand how to balance commercial urgency with compliance safety.</li><li>You have experience with and are comfortable navigating CRM tools (e.g. HubSpot, Zendesk, Salesforce) and back-office admin panels.

We believe in growing together, celebrating successes, and empowering each team member to make a real impact.</p><h3>Role Overview</h3><p>Docket is hiring a Customer Success Engineer (CSE) to serve as Tier 3 technical support and the primary escalation point between Customer Support and Product Engineering.</p><p>This role focuses on investigating, reproducing, and clearly documenting complex technical issues before they reach Engineering. You will work primarily behind the scenes—analyzing data, testing APIs, reviewing logs, and validating system behavior—to turn unclear or incomplete bug reports into clean, actionable engineering tickets.</p><p>This role is ideal for someone who enjoys deep technical problem-solving, debugging, and working through ambiguity in a fast-moving SaaS product.</p><h3>What You’ll Be Doing</h3><ul><li>Own escalated technical issues once they exceed frontline or Tier 2 troubleshooting.</li><li>Reproduce and validate bugs across production, staging, or test environments.</li><li>Determine whether issues are product defects, data inconsistencies, configuration problems, or expected behavior.</li><li>Query databases and review logs to understand system state and failure modes.</li><li>Test backend APIs to isolate and confirm root causes.</li><li>Write or adapt lightweight scripts to support investigation, validation, or data analysis.</li><li>Create high-quality engineering tickets with clear problem statements, reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior, and supporting evidence.</li><li>Partner with Product and Engineering to clarify scope, impact, and priority of escalated issues.</li><li>Identify patterns and recurring issues to help surface systemic problems.</li></ul><h3>Who You Are</h3><p>We’re looking for someone who is ready to jump in, take ownership of complex technical issues, and do hands-on investigation work every day.</p><ul><li>Strong technical foundation. You are comfortable working directly with production data and systems, including:<ul><li>Writing SQL queries against Postgres to investigate and validate data</li><li>Testing APIs using Postman and/or cURL to isolate backend issues</li><li>Writing or adapting Node.js scripts for data parsing, validation, or troubleshooting</li><li>Using Git to check out branches, test fixes, and validate changes</li></ul></li><li>Technically curious and hands-on. You enjoy digging into logs, queries, and system behavior to understand what’s actually happening—not just what was reported.</li><li>Practical and outcome-focused. You care about identifying the root cause and getting issues to a clear next step, not just documenting symptoms.</li><li>Clear and structured communicator. You can turn complex investigations into clean, actionable engineering tickets with clear reproduction steps and supporting evidence.</li><li>Comfortable working deep in the weeds. Investigating bugs, reviewing logs, testing hypotheses, and running scripts are a normal part of your day.</li><li>Organized and accountable. You manage a steady flow of escalations, follow through on investigations, and don’t need constant oversight to stay on track.</li><li>Adaptable and eager to learn. You pick up new systems and workflows quickly and are comfortable working through ambiguity.</li></ul><h3>Base Salary</h3><h3>$75,000 - $90,000 (based on experience)</h3><h3>Benefits and Perks</h3><ul><li>14 Company Holidays in addition to Unlimited PTO </li><li>Healthcare, dental and vision insurance with generous employer contributions</li><li>401K w/ match</li><li>Regular lunches and a fully-stocked kitchen (if in Denver)</li><li>Bi-weekly Grubhub lunch stipend for remote folks</li><li>Company-provided hardware of your choice/configuration</li></ul><h3>Ready to Apply?</h3><p>If you’re ready to bring your energy, skills, and passion for customer support to a fast-paced, growing company, we want to hear from you.
