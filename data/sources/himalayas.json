At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/overstory\">Overstory</a>, we’re harnessing cutting-edge technology to enable a resilient electrical grid that keeps communities thriving as our world changes.</p><p>The grid is the backbone of life as we know it. It powers hospitals, keeps food fresh, and ensures communities stay connected. But extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and growing wildfire risks are putting this critical system under pressure. All of this combined makes the electric utility industry the greatest opportunity for tackling climate change. </p><p>One of the leading causes of catastrophic wildfires and power outages? Trees and brush coming into contact with power lines. </p><p>That’s where we help. At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/overstory\">Overstory</a>, we use AI and advanced satellite imagery to pinpoint and prioritize vegetation risks before they materialize. By giving utilities critical analysis on those risks, we’re helping prevent outages, reduce wildfire risks, and accelerate the transition to a safer, more resilient grid.</p><p>Our team spans the Americas and Europe, and we work with utility partners across the Americas and beyond. We’re outdoor enthusiasts, musicians, artists, athletes, parents, and adventurers—15 nationalities strong and growing. What unites us is a passion for solving complex problems, a commitment to climate action, and the belief that technology should be a force for good.</p><p>Join us to help us build a more resilient world together. </p></div><h3><strong>Role Summary</strong></h3><p>As a <strong>Project Manager</strong> for <strong>Customer Delivery Support</strong>, you’ll enable the successful and timely execution of complex, cross-functional delivery projects for our enterprise customers. In this internal-facing role, you'll serve as the critical bridge between customer deliverables and our internal engineering, product, and customer success teams, managing priorities and timelines for multiple deliveries.  </p><p>Your primary responsibilities include tracking the scope of work we’re delivering for each customer during the entire delivery lifecycle while simultaneously ensuring an accurate and on-time delivery. You’ll also triage a daily backlog of issues and keep internal stakeholders consistently apprised of status.</p><p>This is an exciting opportunity for someone who genuinely enjoys building cross functional relationships, thrives in dynamic settings and is excited to contribute to evolving our customer project management strategy.</p><h3><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Project Delivery Management</strong>: Sustain the end-to-end delivery of multiple concurrent customer projects. </li><li><strong>Cross-Team Coordination</strong>: Own the delivery triage backlog and ensure quick resolution of issues, coordinating priorities with the engineering, product, and customer success teams.</li><li><strong>Timeline Ownership</strong>: Communicate and help teams uphold realistic and ambitious project timelines; proactively identify risks and remove blockers.</li><li><strong>Stakeholder Reporting</strong>: Provide clear, concise status updates and reporting to internal stakeholders.</li><li><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>: Identify process gaps and propose initiatives to improve delivery workflows, reporting, and project outcomes.</li></ul><h3><strong>Requirements</strong></h3><ul><li>5+ years of experience as a Project or Program Manager in a B2B SaaS environment, with a focus on enterprise customers (i.e. 1M+ ARR) with unique and/or complex delivery needs.</li><li>Proven success managing multiple projects simultaneously with cross-functional teams.</li><li>Exceptional organizational skills with the ability to prioritize competing tasks and manage ambiguity.</li><li>Strong communication and collaboration abilities—comfortable aligning diverse stakeholders.</li><li>Experience with using dashboards, workflows, and project management tools (e.g., Monday, Asana, Notion, Linear).</li><li>Engagement with metrics to track project health, diagnose issues early, and help drive continuous improvement in delivery processes.</li><li>Bonus: Experience in geospatial, environmental, or utility technology sectors; experience with scale-up organizations in a globally distributed remote setting.</li></ul><div class=\"content-conclusion\"><h3><strong>About our team</strong></h3><p>We are a group of 100 people from all over the world. Fifteen nationalities are represented in our team. We work remotely from eleven different countries and we are looking for candidates that are also living and working in one of these countries: United States, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland, Estonia, Portugal, France, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, and Canada. We meet up once a year in-person for our unforgettable team gathering event.

      "description": "<p><strong>Attention Architect: </strong>You’ve been shaping stories frame-by-frame for 3+ years, and you know exactly how to combine footage, motion graphics, sound, and pacing to <strong>keep viewers glued to the screen</strong>. You don’t just cut clips. You engineer retention! You can read a script and already see the sequence. You can look at a storyboard and feel the rhythm. And by using DaVinci Resolve, you turn abstract ideas into visual stories that hit both the heart and the algorithm. If that sounds like you, then here’s a cracking opportunity…</p><p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/algaecal\">AlgaeCal</a> is searching for a <strong>Video Editor</strong> who knows how to craft high-retention content for <strong>YouTube</strong>. You’ll know how to build trust, authority, and genuine connection with our audience using motion graphics, mixed media, sound design, and world-class pacing to make every second count.</p><p><strong>Small print here ⇒ If you don’t have expert-level editing skills in DaVinci Resolve this probably isn’t the role for you. </strong></p><h3>This job will give you ALL the feels:</h3><p>At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/algaecal\">AlgaeCal</a>, we’re driven by a single idea. To end the fear of bone loss. In the United States, an estimated 54 million people have low bone density.</p><p>The good news? <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/algaecal\">AlgaeCal</a> has the world’s only clinically-supported natural solution to this problem. We give hope to everyone worried about bone loss. If that excites you, you’ll find no better place to continue your career than at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/algaecal\">AlgaeCal</a>.</p><h3>This job might be for you if you’ve got…</h3><p><strong>An impressive portfolio: </strong>When we look at your work, we’ll see that you don’t just edit what’s said, you show what it means. You can take abstract concepts, dense explanations, or interview snippets and instantly picture the sequence: b-roll, motion text, transitions, visual metaphors, and sound cues. You’ve built long-form videos where every major talking point is supported by a deliberate visual asset—animation, stock, AI-generated footage, whatever the story demands. And you’ll have no problems delivering 4–6 polished, narrative-driven videos a month.</p><p><strong>An obsession with retention: </strong>You measure success in AVD, not vibes. You spot drop-off risks before they happen and instinctively deploy pattern interrupts—motion bursts, angle changes, text builds, dynamic cuts—to keep the viewer hooked. A static talking head lasting more than 5 seconds? Not on your watch. You’ve built videos that hit 50%+ APV by default because you understand that on YouTube, visual variety is oxygen.</p><p><strong>A knack for first impressions: </strong>You know the first 30 seconds determine everything: CTR, watch time, whether viewers swipe away or buckle in. That’s why you design visual cold opens—motion graphics, kinetic text, punchy imagery—that create immediate curiosity and momentum. You can take an ordinary explanation and turn it into a compelling visual promise the viewer has to see unfold.</p><p><strong>Yoda-Level skills with DaVinci Resolve:</strong> You’re fluent in Edit, Color, and Fairlight, and you know exactly how to elevate production value without slowing the process. You’ve built reusable Fusion assets—lower thirds, transitions, animated elements—that boost team efficiency. Your color grading is clean and purposeful, your mixes are balanced, and your exports are flawless across formats.</p><p><strong>A motion designer’s bag of tricks:</strong> Kinetic typography? Animated charts? Mixed-media sequences that make complex ideas make sense? Easy. You rebuild moments using 2D animation, compositing, or custom motion text that reinforces the script instead of distracting from it. Whether in Fusion or After Effects, you craft visuals that help create enviable retention numbers.</p><p><strong>A nose for the PERFECT visual: </strong>You don’t grab random stock clips and hope they work. You hunt for the exact shot that reinforces the narrative. And if it doesn’t exist, you know how to leverage AI tools like Midjourney or Runway to bridge visual gaps while keeping everything on-brand and high-quality. Your videos feel intentional because they are.</p><p><strong>Mr Beast-Level YouTube smarts:</strong> Okay, maybe not yet! But you do understand how editing shapes retention, CTR, and watchability. You know when to add breathing room, when to punch up energy, when to cut, and when to build anticipation. You design end screens with purpose, structure arcs around curiosity, and edit with the algorithm (and the human brain) in mind.</p><p><strong>An ear for emotional pacing: </strong>You can elevate a scene with a single whoosh, sting, or swell. Your soundscapes guide viewers through tension, clarity, excitement, and resolution. You treat audio as a storytelling tool, not background noise—and your videos feel better because your sound design is doing invisible heavy lifting.</p><p><strong>A mind like a sponge:  </strong>You bring ideas to creative sessions—visual metaphors, animation approaches, structural improvements—because you love shaping the story before it even hits the timeline. And when feedback comes, you absorb it, translate it, elevate the work, and come back with something stronger. Not because you have to. Because excellence is your default.</p><p>Now, time to be honest: is this really you? If you’re nodding your head and feeling that flutter of excitement, then we can’t wait to meet you.</p><h3>Other Qualities You’ll Need</h3><p>At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/algaecal\">AlgaeCal</a> we’re going to insist that you have these 3 qualities:</p><ul><li>You’re humble--you put the team and others’ needs ahead of your own</li><li>You’re hungry to learn more</li><li>You’re people smart--in the sense that you’re a great teammate</li></ul><p>The truth is, if you don’t have these qualities you won’t last long at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/algaecal\">AlgaeCal</a>.
