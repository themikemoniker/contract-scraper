You will work with other engineers in a flat and inclusive culture where engineers have a say in both key product and technology decisions.

At KOMOJU, you are the main driver behind your growth and position in the company.</p><h3><strong>International at our core</strong></h3><p>Most of our engineering team members come from outside Japan.

You will also work with your fellow developers and provide constructive feedback through code reviews, look at refactoring opportunities, and helping improve the codebase. You will receive mentoring support from managers and senior developers to help develop your skills as realizing growth potential is a key goal.</p><p>Our ideal candidate has experience working with large web applications. They will know how to build reliable and performant web applications. Testing and code quality are also extremely important to us, so having a strong knowledge of testing and the different testing types is required.</p><h3>Responsibilities</h3><ul><ul><ul><li>Build backend systems using Ruby on Rails stack.</li><li>Understand product goals and feature requests and translate them into working software</li><li>Work on large technical projects from design through implementation and delivery as part of a team</li><li>Ensure high-quality, reliable software - including thorough testing.</li></ul></ul></ul><h3>Requirements</h3><ul><ul><ul><li>You are familiar enough with Ruby to discuss topics such as the Object Hierarchy and meta-programming features such as `method_missing`</li><li>Experience with building performant and scalable Ruby applications.</li><li>Ability to design data models and system architectures.</li><li>Strong technical communication skills - including the ability to document decisions clearly and concisely</li><li>Experience and understanding of common web vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them</li><li>Understanding of software architecture, design patterns and best practices</li></ul></ul></ul><h3>Nice to Haves</h3><ul><ul><ul><li>Experience with TypeScript, Vue.js, or React</li><li>Experience with payments or payment systems</li><li>Experience with integrating with third party APIs in a secure and fault-tolerant manner</li><li>Understanding of database performance characteristics and data access patterns</li><li>Familiarity with Monitoring and Observability techniques and platforms such as DataDog.</li></ul></ul></ul><h3><strong>What is the process like?</strong></h3><ul><li>We aim to keep our hiring process thoughtful and efficient, typically involving 3-4 stages depending on the role: an initial screening, a take-home exercise, a technical (team) interview, and a final interview with leadership.
