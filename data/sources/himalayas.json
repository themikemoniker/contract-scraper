We’ve doubled our activity year-on-year for the last 3 years because our platform delivers exceptional impact in every single implementation. As we scale internationally, we are looking for an Engineering leader to help us navigate the complex engineering challenges of global healthcare interoperability. This is a rare chance to lead an exceptional team where your work directly translates to saved lives and better patient outcomes.</p><h3>What You’ll Do</h3><ul><li>You’ll own the Engineering Function: Lead, scale, and inspire the entire engineering team, driving a high-performance culture that balances aggressive weekly delivery with uncompromising quality.</li><li>Plan for scale: Strategically plan and execute a technology roadmap that maintains system stability and performance as we continue to double our activity year-over-year.</li><li>Drive technical strategy: Act as a proactive product partner, aligning technical execution with business objectives to support our rapid expansion into the NHS and international markets.</li><li>Embed operational excellence: Refine best-in-class engineering practices—including CI/CD, rigorous testing, and code review standards—to ensure zero major production incidents during rapid deployment.</li></ul><h3>Who We Are</h3><p>We are creating a new operating model for health care where the majority of patients can be managed asynchronously and remotely. The <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/isla\">Isla</a> platform is the technology which enabled this shift safely and at scale. <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/isla\">Isla</a> enables the secure submission of photos, videos, digital PROMS, consent forms and sound recordings by patients and clinicians. Remote submissions empower patients to monitor their own conditions safely at home and clinician capture allows patients to be baselined and to build up a view of patient progress.</p><p>Since going live in our first pilot sites over 3 years ago, <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/isla\">Isla</a> has scaled quickly and is now working with 33 Trusts across the NHS and have launched our first international projects in Trinidad and Tobago and Ireland. <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/isla\">Isla</a> is an intuitive and highly scalable solution which can be deployed across multiple specialties and can support patients right across their healthcare journey.</p><h3>The Team</h3><p>You will be joining a lean, elite engineering organisation.

We prioritise tools that enable velocity (leaning in to AI workflows as much as we can) and reliability, ensuring that every line of code moves us closer to transforming global health pathways.</p><p>Who you’ll work with: You will lead a talented group of 3 EMs, each running their own team. As the Director, you will report into the cofounder CTO along with our existing DIrectors of Product &amp; Design respectively. You will join a leadership team that is deeply committed to technical excellence. You’ll be surrounded by teammates who have come from high-growth environments and are here because they want to solve the hardest problems in healthcare.</p><h3>Over the next 12 months you will:</h3><ul><li>Refine and embed engineering practices (e.g., CI/CD, testing, code review standards) to deliver product features at an aggressive cadence with zero major production incidents.</li><li>Own and drive the technical roadmap, ensuring system architecture scales efficiently to support our international expansion and new operating model for healthcare.</li><li>Work with our EMs to map our product roadmap into technical plans to ensure a technical infrastructure which allows us to scale &amp; iterate quickly</li><li>Scale the team’s impact, either through hiring or investing in tools &amp; professional development to allow the team to flourish. </li></ul><h3>Requirements</h3><ul><li>Proven work experience as an engineering leader</li><li>A fierce focus on quality and execution, ensuring that the team continues to operate at a high level </li><li>A deep technical understanding across (ideally both, but at least one of) Angular &amp; GCP to support strategic technical decision making</li></ul><p>We appreciate you might not meet all of the requirements for this position. If your experience looks somewhat different to the requirements in the job spec but you think you can bring value to this role, we’d love to hear from you.</p><h3>Benefits</h3><h3>🕜 Flexible working times</h3><h3>🌍 Work abroad for up to 90 days per year</h3><p>🏖️ 25 days annual leave (on top of public holidays)</p><p>🎂 Take your birthday off 🎄 Take Christmas Eve off too</p><h3>🧘‍♀️ Generous well-being perks</h3><p>📚 An annual learning budget to support your growth</p><p>🌍 Delivering social impact through improved patient healthcare</p><p>💡 Working at a well funded and rapidly growing start up, solving a global problem in a new way</p><p>🎇 A whole lot of fun on an exciting journey</p><h3>------</h3><h3>What is the hiring process for this role at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/isla\">Isla</a>?</h3><p>Interviewing with us for the Director of Engineering  role will be split into 3 stages (all conducted virtually):</p><p>1️⃣ A screening interview with one of our Operations Managers - 15 minutes</p><p>2️⃣ A technical strategy deep dive: We will run through a scenario to challenge you on your decision making, the speed of your technical understanding, your communication and your out-of-the-box thinking </p><p>3️⃣ Founder interview: To deep dive in to how you operate as a leader to achieve amazing outcomes</p><h3>------</h3><h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3><p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/isla\">Isla</a> is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to building an inclusive and diverse team.

This role combines hands-on technical execution (web design, development, content production) with rigorous project coordination and process ownership. You’ll act as the link between partners, internal strategists, and contract developers, translating requests into action, building systems that scale, and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.</p><p>This is a good fit for someone with deep creative agency experience who's worn all the hats, someone who's gone from client call to wireframe to deployed site in the same week and enjoyed every part of it. You get genuine satisfaction from bringing order to complexity, you treat clear communication as a craft worth perfecting, and you're energized by the challenge of building operational infrastructure while the plane is in flight.</p><p>This is a full-time, remote position in the United States.</p><p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/freewill\">FreeWill</a> has set compensation and a non-negotiation policy for fairness reasons (we don't think that an individual's pay should be determined by how comfortable they are negotiating). As a result, we like to be transparent and up front about the compensation. When we make an offer, we provide multiple options so that employees can choose between compensation packages that prioritize salary or stock options. <strong>The salary for this role is $70,000 and will come with equity and full benefits. </strong></p><h3><strong>What you'll do</strong></h3><ul><li>Serve as the primary point of contact for partner requests, managing intake through shared inboxes and Slack, setting expectations, and providing clear status updates throughout the project lifecycle.</li><li>Coordinate work across contract developers by scoping requests, assigning tasks, tracking progress, and ensuring deliverables meet quality standards before they reach partners.</li><li>Execute design and development work directly, including building and modifying sites in WordPress, creating and editing visual assets in Photoshop or Figma, and writing clean HTML/CSS/JS when the situation calls for it. Git and GitHub are part of your regular workflow, not something you need to Google.</li><li>Own project tracking and documentation in Notion, maintaining accurate records of decisions, partner context, and project status so the team always knows where things stand.</li><li>Build and refine operational systems, including intake workflows, QC checklists, handoff processes, and documentation standards. Conduct quarterly reviews to identify what's working and what needs to change.</li><li>Handle bespoke and one-off requests with flexibility, problem-solving edge cases that don't fit standard workflows, while flagging patterns that suggest the need for new processes.</li><li>QC completed work for accuracy, brand consistency, and basic accessibility before delivery.</li><li>Communicate proactively, clearly, and with empathy with partners and internal stakeholders- setting expectations, confirming launches, explaining delays, and providing technical guidance in ways they can genuinely understand.</li></ul><h3><strong>What we're looking for</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Operational obsession. </strong>You notice inefficiencies, you document what you learn, and you build systems that make future work easier. You find satisfaction in a clean tracker and a well-written process doc.</li><li><strong>Real web design and development chops.</strong> You've built websites from scratch, not just edited templates. You’re fluent in HTML and CSS, with strong JavaScript experience using React and Next.js. You work comfortably in WordPress, you're at home in GitHub, and you can move between design tools and code editors without friction.</li><li><strong>Agency generalist background.</strong> You've worked somewhere that required you to be a designer on Monday, a developer on Tuesday, a project manager on Wednesday, and client-facing all three days. You know how to ship work with limited resources and tight timelines.</li><li><strong>Excellent written communication.</strong> You write clearly and concisely for different audiences, whether that's a partner who needs a plain-English explanation or a developer who needs precise specs. You take pride in emails that don't require follow-up questions.</li><li><strong>Comfort with ambiguity and change.</strong> The product offering evolves, partners have unique needs, and priorities shift. You adapt without losing your grip on what's in flight.</li><li><strong>Attention to detail and follow-through.</strong> You catch errors before they ship, you close loops, and you don't let things quietly drop.</li></ul><h3><strong>Nice to have</strong></h3><ul><li>Experience with Notion, Figma, or similar tools for project management and design collaboration.</li><li>Familiarity with domains, DNS, analytics platforms, or accessibility standards (WCAG).</li><li>Background in nonprofit tech, SaaS, or B2B environments.</li><li>Experience managing or coordinating contractors or freelancers.</li></ul><h3><strong>Hiring Process:</strong></h3><ul><li>Initial Phone Screen (30 minutes)</li><li>Hiring Manager Video Interview (30 minutes)</li><li>Take Home Assignment (1 hour; on your own time)</li><li>Final Video Interview (30 minutes; small panel of <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/freewill\">FreeWill</a> team members) </li><li>Offer (contingent on positive references)</li></ul><p>Please note that steps in the hiring process can and may change and the Recruiter will be your point of contact in sharing any updates in terms of the process. If you are selected to move forward in this process, the Recruiter will share more details about the hiring process and interviewers. However, this is a good estimate of what you can expect. For most roles, our hiring processes take an average of 4-6 weeks.</p><h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3><p>In addition to the immense personal and professional satisfaction you’ll gain from helping to raise $1T for high impact nonprofits in a kind and joyful work environment, full time employees at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/freewill\">FreeWill</a> are eligible for the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Work from home </li><li>Flexible Paid Time Off policy. We trust staff to manage their own schedules and take the time off you need to be your best, as long as your work is on track. We recommend staff take a minimum of three weeks annually</li><li>Flexible hours</li><li>Competitive salary</li><li>Commuter benefits</li><li>Company stock options</li><li>401k</li><li>Medical/Dental/Vision (some single coverage medical plans are 100% employer paid, subsidized rates for spousal, parent-child, and family coverage)</li><li>Short-term and long-term disability insurance</li><li>Life and AD&amp;D insurance</li><li>Free One Medical membership</li><li>Paid parental leave for all parents</li></ul><h3><strong>Perks</strong></h3><ul><li>Regular (virtual) team events</li><li>$250 monthly co-working budget which can be used for local co-working spaces and your home wifi bill</li><li>$300 annual budget to outfit your home office or cover utility bills</li><li>$1,000 referral bonuses for growing our <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/freewill\">FreeWill</a> community</li><li>$1,000 annual professional development budget</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/freewill\">FreeWill</a> is an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity. We are committed to finding talent that is not determined on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status, or any other characteristic protected by law.</p><p>We are a remote-first company that’s able to hire in 47 states and D.C. Unfortunately, we are unable to hire in Colorado, Alabama, or Louisiana at this time. We also can’t sponsor working visas, so all applicants will need to have work authorization in the US.</p><p>Don’t check off every box in the requirements listed above? Please apply anyway! Studies have shown that marginalized communities - such as women, LGBTQ+ and people of color - are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single qualification. <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/freewill\">FreeWill</a> is dedicated to building an inclusive, diverse, equitable, and accessible workplace that fosters a sense of belonging – so if you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to still consider submitting an application. You may be just the right candidate for this role or another one of our openings!</p><h3><strong>AI Policy</strong></h3><p>We are excited to engage with candidates who can demonstrate their experience and skills through their own words and work, not through AI-generated content. We want to understand your genuine interest in the company and your unique perspectives, not simply AI-driven responses. We ask that you refrain from use of AI-generated content during the hiring process which includes phone screens, video interviews, tech screens, or other assessment stages except as otherwise indicated to you by the Recruiter.</p><p>For example: Using ChatGPT to generate scripted answers to application questions or during phone screens and video interviews is strongly discouraged and will result in not moving forward in the hiring process. However, the use of an AI design tool to enhance the design of a presentation deck is permitted.</p><p>The Recruiter will be able to provide additional guidance during the hiring process if needed. If hired at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/freewill\">FreeWill</a>, we do encourage the use of AI in your role to build upon or enhance your skill set.</p><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

This role combines hands-on technical execution (web design, development, content production) with rigorous project coordination and process ownership. You’ll act as the link between partners, internal strategists, and contract developers, translating requests into action, building systems that scale, and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.</p><p>This is a good fit for someone with deep creative agency experience who's worn all the hats, someone who's gone from client call to wireframe to deployed site in the same week and enjoyed every part of it. You get genuine satisfaction from bringing order to complexity, you treat clear communication as a craft worth perfecting, and you're energized by the challenge of building operational infrastructure while the plane is in flight.</p><p>This is a full-time, remote position in the United States.</p><p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/freewill\">FreeWill</a> has set compensation and a non-negotiation policy for fairness reasons (we don't think that an individual's pay should be determined by how comfortable they are negotiating). As a result, we like to be transparent and up front about the compensation. When we make an offer, we provide multiple options so that employees can choose between compensation packages that prioritize salary or stock options. <strong>The salary for this role is $70,000 and will come with equity and full benefits. </strong></p><h3><strong>What you'll do</strong></h3><ul><li>Serve as the primary point of contact for partner requests, managing intake through shared inboxes and Slack, setting expectations, and providing clear status updates throughout the project lifecycle.</li><li>Coordinate work across contract developers by scoping requests, assigning tasks, tracking progress, and ensuring deliverables meet quality standards before they reach partners.</li><li>Execute design and development work directly, including building and modifying sites in WordPress, creating and editing visual assets in Photoshop or Figma, and writing clean HTML/CSS/JS when the situation calls for it. Git and GitHub are part of your regular workflow, not something you need to Google.</li><li>Own project tracking and documentation in Notion, maintaining accurate records of decisions, partner context, and project status so the team always knows where things stand.</li><li>Build and refine operational systems, including intake workflows, QC checklists, handoff processes, and documentation standards. Conduct quarterly reviews to identify what's working and what needs to change.</li><li>Handle bespoke and one-off requests with flexibility, problem-solving edge cases that don't fit standard workflows, while flagging patterns that suggest the need for new processes.</li><li>QC completed work for accuracy, brand consistency, and basic accessibility before delivery.</li><li>Communicate proactively, clearly, and with empathy with partners and internal stakeholders- setting expectations, confirming launches, explaining delays, and providing technical guidance in ways they can genuinely understand.</li></ul><h3><strong>What we're looking for</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Operational obsession. </strong>You notice inefficiencies, you document what you learn, and you build systems that make future work easier. You find satisfaction in a clean tracker and a well-written process doc.</li><li><strong>Real web design and development chops.</strong> You've built websites from scratch, not just edited templates. You’re fluent in HTML and CSS, with strong JavaScript experience using React and Next.js. You work comfortably in WordPress, you're at home in GitHub, and you can move between design tools and code editors without friction.</li><li><strong>Agency generalist background.</strong> You've worked somewhere that required you to be a designer on Monday, a developer on Tuesday, a project manager on Wednesday, and client-facing all three days. You know how to ship work with limited resources and tight timelines.</li><li><strong>Excellent written communication.</strong> You write clearly and concisely for different audiences, whether that's a partner who needs a plain-English explanation or a developer who needs precise specs. You take pride in emails that don't require follow-up questions.</li><li><strong>Comfort with ambiguity and change.</strong> The product offering evolves, partners have unique needs, and priorities shift. You adapt without losing your grip on what's in flight.</li><li><strong>Attention to detail and follow-through.</strong> You catch errors before they ship, you close loops, and you don't let things quietly drop.</li></ul><h3><strong>Nice to have</strong></h3><ul><li>Experience with Notion, Figma, or similar tools for project management and design collaboration.</li><li>Familiarity with domains, DNS, analytics platforms, or accessibility standards (WCAG).</li><li>Background in nonprofit tech, SaaS, or B2B environments.</li><li>Experience managing or coordinating contractors or freelancers.</li></ul><h3><strong>Hiring Process:</strong></h3><ul><li>Initial Phone Screen (30 minutes)</li><li>Hiring Manager Video Interview (30 minutes)</li><li>Take Home Assignment (1 hour; on your own time)</li><li>Final Video Interview (30 minutes; small panel of <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/freewill\">FreeWill</a> team members) </li><li>Offer (contingent on positive references)</li></ul><p>Please note that steps in the hiring process can and may change and the Recruiter will be your point of contact in sharing any updates in terms of the process. If you are selected to move forward in this process, the Recruiter will share more details about the hiring process and interviewers. However, this is a good estimate of what you can expect. For most roles, our hiring processes take an average of 4-6 weeks.</p><h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3><p>In addition to the immense personal and professional satisfaction you’ll gain from helping to raise $1T for high impact nonprofits in a kind and joyful work environment, full time employees at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/freewill\">FreeWill</a> are eligible for the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Work from home </li><li>Flexible Paid Time Off policy.

We recommend staff take a minimum of three weeks annually</li><li>Flexible hours</li><li>Competitive salary</li><li>Commuter benefits</li><li>Company stock options</li><li>401k</li><li>Medical/Dental/Vision (some single coverage medical plans are 100% employer paid, subsidized rates for spousal, parent-child, and family coverage)</li><li>Short-term and long-term disability insurance</li><li>Life and AD&amp;D insurance</li><li>Free One Medical membership</li><li>Paid parental leave for all parents</li></ul><h3><strong>Perks</strong></h3><ul><li>Regular (virtual) team events</li><li>$250 monthly co-working budget which can be used for local co-working spaces and your home wifi bill</li><li>$300 annual budget to outfit your home office or cover utility bills</li><li>$1,000 referral bonuses for growing our <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/freewill\">FreeWill</a> community</li><li>$1,000 annual professional development budget</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/freewill\">FreeWill</a> is an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity. We are committed to finding talent that is not determined on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status, or any other characteristic protected by law.</p><p>We are a remote-first company that’s able to hire in 47 states and D.C. Unfortunately, we are unable to hire in Colorado, Alabama, or Louisiana at this time. We also can’t sponsor working visas, so all applicants will need to have work authorization in the US.</p><p>Don’t check off every box in the requirements listed above? Please apply anyway! Studies have shown that marginalized communities - such as women, LGBTQ+ and people of color - are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single qualification. <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/freewill\">FreeWill</a> is dedicated to building an inclusive, diverse, equitable, and accessible workplace that fosters a sense of belonging – so if you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to still consider submitting an application. You may be just the right candidate for this role or another one of our openings!</p><h3><strong>AI Policy</strong></h3><p>We are excited to engage with candidates who can demonstrate their experience and skills through their own words and work, not through AI-generated content. We want to understand your genuine interest in the company and your unique perspectives, not simply AI-driven responses. We ask that you refrain from use of AI-generated content during the hiring process which includes phone screens, video interviews, tech screens, or other assessment stages except as otherwise indicated to you by the Recruiter.</p><p>For example: Using ChatGPT to generate scripted answers to application questions or during phone screens and video interviews is strongly discouraged and will result in not moving forward in the hiring process. However, the use of an AI design tool to enhance the design of a presentation deck is permitted.</p><p>The Recruiter will be able to provide additional guidance during the hiring process if needed. If hired at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/freewill\">FreeWill</a>, we do encourage the use of AI in your role to build upon or enhance your skill set.</p><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",
