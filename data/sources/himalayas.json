That’s why we connect the best and brightest professionals with career-defining opportunities that challenge, inspire, and accelerate their career growth. Our community, whom we call <strong>Divers,</strong> don’t just work—they dive deep, solve complex challenges, and make a real impact with global industry leaders. And in doing so, they don’t just support bold ideas—they expand their skills, broaden their expertise, and grow their careers.</p><p>We’re looking for a<strong> FP&amp;A Director</strong> to partner directly with the Founder / CEO of an early-stage, high-growth DTC subscription business. This is a senior, analysis-first finance role with full ownership of financial planning, forecasting, modeling, and strategic decision support.</p><p>This is not a reporting-only role. You’ll act as the primary finance partner to executive leadership - answering real-time questions on cash, runway, and trade-offs - while building scalable financial foundations that support long-term growth. This role is best suited for someone who thrives in ambiguity, thinks in scenarios, and uses financial insight to guide decisions, not just explain outcomes.</p><h3>Accountability</h3><p>As an FP&amp;A Director, your success will be defined by your ability to own the company’s financial planning and forecasting engine, translate complex financial data into clear executive narratives, and provide trusted decision support to leadership. You’ll bring rigor, clarity, and foresight to financial decisions - balancing growth ambitions with cash discipline and long-term sustainability.</p><h3>Here’s how you’ll make an impact:</h3><h3><strong>Financial Planning &amp; Forecasting</strong></h3><ul><li>Own annual budgets, rolling forecasts, and long-range financial plans (1-year, 5-year, and 10-year horizons).</li><li>Set and maintain planning methodologies aligned to growth strategy and cash runway objectives.</li><li>Analyze budget vs. actuals and clearly communicate drivers, risks, and opportunities to leadership.</li><li>Deliver ad-hoc financial analysis to support operational and strategic decision-making.</li></ul><h3><strong>Financial Modeling &amp; Unit Economics</strong></h3><ul><li>Build, own, and continuously refine multi-scenario operating models used by leadership for planning and decision-making.</li><li>Own unit economics across COGS, fulfillment, packaging, and subscription margins.</li><li>Develop scenario-based models to evaluate pricing changes, cost structures, and growth initiatives.</li><li>Lead margin optimization and subscription profitability analysis as the business evolves.</li></ul><h3><strong>Cash &amp; Strategic Finance</strong></h3><ul><li>Own cash flow forecasting, runway modeling, and working capital insights.</li><li>Confidently answer leadership questions related to burn rate, runway, and financial trade-offs.</li><li>Provide risk-aware recommendations backed by quantitative analysis and scenario planning.</li><li>Support high-impact executive discussions with clear financial narratives and sensitivities.</li></ul><h3><strong>Finance Operations Oversight</strong></h3><ul><li>Partner closely with controllers, bookkeepers, and external accounting firms.</li><li>Review monthly close outputs, accruals, and financial accuracy without directly executing accounting transactions.</li><li>Ensure GAAP-aligned reporting and financial hygiene as the company scales.</li><li>Identify gaps in finance processes and help implement scalable improvements.</li></ul><h3><strong>Business Partnering</strong></h3><ul><li>Act as the primary finance partner to the Founder / CEO.</li><li>Translate financial outputs into actionable, decision-ready recommendations.</li><li>Influence strategic and operational decisions through clear, concise financial storytelling.</li></ul><h3>Colleagues</h3><p>Your primary stakeholder will be the Founder / CEO, with close collaboration across leadership, operations, and external accounting partners. You’ll work alongside controllers, bookkeepers, and tax advisors to ensure accurate financials while maintaining an FP&amp;A-led focus.</p><p>At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/oceans\">Oceans</a>, you’ll also receive guidance and support from our Operations Manager, who will help you succeed in this role and ensure that you’re continuously growing and developing in your career.</p><h3>Skills &amp; Qualifications</h3><p>At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/oceans\">Oceans</a>, we believe in T-shaped individuals—those who bring deep expertise in one area, paired with broad curiosity and interests. As an FP&amp;A Director, your vertical strength will be financial planning, modeling, and strategic finance, while your horizontal capabilities should span communication, business partnering, and finance operations oversight.</p><h3>To excel in this role, you should have:</h3><ul><li><strong>FP&amp;A Experience:</strong> Strong background in FP&amp;A within DTC, subscription, or consumer businesses.</li><li><strong>Financial Modeling: </strong>Advanced modeling and forecasting expertise, including scenario and sensitivity analysis.</li><li><strong>Accounting Knowledge:</strong> Deep understanding of accrual accounting and GAAP at an oversight level.</li><li><strong>Tools:</strong> High proficiency in Excel and/or Google Sheets for complex modeling and analysis.</li><li><strong>Ownership Mindset:</strong> Comfort operating with high autonomy in early-stage, fast-moving environments.</li><li><strong>Executive Communication:</strong> Ability to clearly explain financial trade-offs to non-finance leaders.</li><li><strong>DTC or subscription metrics familiarity : </strong>(LTV, CAC, churn, cohort margins), early-stage company experience, or prior FP&amp;A leadership exposure without people management will be considered strong advantage</li></ul><p>Diversity of experience is core to <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/oceans\">Oceans</a>. You are expected to work inclusively with individuals from a variety of backgrounds, ensuring that both personal and collective dignity are supported.</p><p>During the interview process, you’ll have the opportunity to showcase your skills in the following areas:</p><ul><li><strong>FP&amp;A Ownership:</strong> How you’ve owned budgeting, rolling forecasts, and planning end-to-end.</li><li><strong>Financial Modeling:</strong> Your approach to scenario modeling and adapting models as variables change.</li><li><strong>Cash &amp; Runway Analysis:</strong> How you assess burn, runway, and financial risk.</li><li><strong>Decision Support: </strong>How you translate financial analysis into executive-level recommendations.</li><li><strong>Stakeholder Partnership: </strong>Your experience partnering directly with founders or senior leadership.</li></ul><h3>Role Specifications</h3><p>This is a<strong> remote role</strong>, where you will be expected to work a split shift with some overlap with our client’s time zone. You will, however, be expected to be present for in-person training programs during your first 90 days with us. During the offer process, we’ll share more information about our benefits and compensation philosophy, considering both market trends and individual factors.</p><h3>About <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/oceans\">Oceans</a></h3><p>At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/oceans\">Oceans</a>, we build remote teams that connect the world’s top 1% of talent with visionary leaders.

Your career, redefined.</strong></p><p>(NOTE: A human reviews every application at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/oceans\">Oceans</a>, so please <strong>apply for only one position and only once a year</strong>—if you're a better fit for another role, we’ll route your application accordingly and if we’re not quite ready for you, we’ll reach back out later).</p><p>At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/oceans\">Oceans</a>, we believe that talent knows no boundaries. That’s why we connect the best and brightest professionals with career-defining opportunities that challenge, inspire, and accelerate their career growth. Our community, whom we call <strong>Divers,</strong> don’t just work—they dive deep, solve complex challenges, and make a real impact with global industry leaders. And in doing so, they don’t just support bold ideas—they expand their skills, broaden their expertise, and grow their careers.</p><p>We’re looking for a<strong> FP&amp;A Director</strong> to partner directly with the Founder / CEO of an early-stage, high-growth DTC subscription business. This is a senior, analysis-first finance role with full ownership of financial planning, forecasting, modeling, and strategic decision support.</p><p>This is not a reporting-only role. You’ll act as the primary finance partner to executive leadership - answering real-time questions on cash, runway, and trade-offs - while building scalable financial foundations that support long-term growth. This role is best suited for someone who thrives in ambiguity, thinks in scenarios, and uses financial insight to guide decisions, not just explain outcomes.</p><h3>Accountability</h3><p>As an FP&amp;A Director, your success will be defined by your ability to own the company’s financial planning and forecasting engine, translate complex financial data into clear executive narratives, and provide trusted decision support to leadership. You’ll bring rigor, clarity, and foresight to financial decisions - balancing growth ambitions with cash discipline and long-term sustainability.</p><h3>Here’s how you’ll make an impact:</h3><h3><strong>Financial Planning &amp; Forecasting</strong></h3><ul><li>Own annual budgets, rolling forecasts, and long-range financial plans (1-year, 5-year, and 10-year horizons).</li><li>Set and maintain planning methodologies aligned to growth strategy and cash runway objectives.</li><li>Analyze budget vs. actuals and clearly communicate drivers, risks, and opportunities to leadership.</li><li>Deliver ad-hoc financial analysis to support operational and strategic decision-making.</li></ul><h3><strong>Financial Modeling &amp; Unit Economics</strong></h3><ul><li>Build, own, and continuously refine multi-scenario operating models used by leadership for planning and decision-making.</li><li>Own unit economics across COGS, fulfillment, packaging, and subscription margins.</li><li>Develop scenario-based models to evaluate pricing changes, cost structures, and growth initiatives.</li><li>Lead margin optimization and subscription profitability analysis as the business evolves.</li></ul><h3><strong>Cash &amp; Strategic Finance</strong></h3><ul><li>Own cash flow forecasting, runway modeling, and working capital insights.</li><li>Confidently answer leadership questions related to burn rate, runway, and financial trade-offs.</li><li>Provide risk-aware recommendations backed by quantitative analysis and scenario planning.</li><li>Support high-impact executive discussions with clear financial narratives and sensitivities.</li></ul><h3><strong>Finance Operations Oversight</strong></h3><ul><li>Partner closely with controllers, bookkeepers, and external accounting firms.</li><li>Review monthly close outputs, accruals, and financial accuracy without directly executing accounting transactions.</li><li>Ensure GAAP-aligned reporting and financial hygiene as the company scales.</li><li>Identify gaps in finance processes and help implement scalable improvements.</li></ul><h3><strong>Business Partnering</strong></h3><ul><li>Act as the primary finance partner to the Founder / CEO.</li><li>Translate financial outputs into actionable, decision-ready recommendations.</li><li>Influence strategic and operational decisions through clear, concise financial storytelling.</li></ul><h3>Colleagues</h3><p>Your primary stakeholder will be the Founder / CEO, with close collaboration across leadership, operations, and external accounting partners. You’ll work alongside controllers, bookkeepers, and tax advisors to ensure accurate financials while maintaining an FP&amp;A-led focus.</p><p>At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/oceans\">Oceans</a>, you’ll also receive guidance and support from our Operations Manager, who will help you succeed in this role and ensure that you’re continuously growing and developing in your career.</p><h3>Skills &amp; Qualifications</h3><p>At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/oceans\">Oceans</a>, we believe in T-shaped individuals—those who bring deep expertise in one area, paired with broad curiosity and interests. As an FP&amp;A Director, your vertical strength will be financial planning, modeling, and strategic finance, while your horizontal capabilities should span communication, business partnering, and finance operations oversight.</p><h3>To excel in this role, you should have:</h3><ul><li><strong>FP&amp;A Experience:</strong> Strong background in FP&amp;A within DTC, subscription, or consumer businesses.</li><li><strong>Financial Modeling: </strong>Advanced modeling and forecasting expertise, including scenario and sensitivity analysis.</li><li><strong>Accounting Knowledge:</strong> Deep understanding of accrual accounting and GAAP at an oversight level.</li><li><strong>Tools:</strong> High proficiency in Excel and/or Google Sheets for complex modeling and analysis.</li><li><strong>Ownership Mindset:</strong> Comfort operating with high autonomy in early-stage, fast-moving environments.</li><li><strong>Executive Communication:</strong> Ability to clearly explain financial trade-offs to non-finance leaders.</li><li><strong>DTC or subscription metrics familiarity : </strong>(LTV, CAC, churn, cohort margins), early-stage company experience, or prior FP&amp;A leadership exposure without people management will be considered strong advantage</li></ul><p>Diversity of experience is core to <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/oceans\">Oceans</a>. You are expected to work inclusively with individuals from a variety of backgrounds, ensuring that both personal and collective dignity are supported.</p><p>During the interview process, you’ll have the opportunity to showcase your skills in the following areas:</p><ul><li><strong>FP&amp;A Ownership:</strong> How you’ve owned budgeting, rolling forecasts, and planning end-to-end.</li><li><strong>Financial Modeling:</strong> Your approach to scenario modeling and adapting models as variables change.</li><li><strong>Cash &amp; Runway Analysis:</strong> How you assess burn, runway, and financial risk.</li><li><strong>Decision Support: </strong>How you translate financial analysis into executive-level recommendations.</li><li><strong>Stakeholder Partnership: </strong>Your experience partnering directly with founders or senior leadership.</li></ul><h3>Role Specifications</h3><p>This is a<strong> remote role</strong>, where you will be expected to work a split shift with some overlap with our client’s time zone. You will, however, be expected to be present for in-person training programs during your first 90 days with us. During the offer process, we’ll share more information about our benefits and compensation philosophy, considering both market trends and individual factors.</p><h3>About <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/oceans\">Oceans</a></h3><p>At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/oceans\">Oceans</a>, we build remote teams that connect the world’s top 1% of talent with visionary leaders.

We believed that if we started with local content in their own language, they’d come back every day; once there was a habit and trust, that same space could naturally grow into classifieds and, eventually, something they used for almost everything online.This spark became <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/lokal\">Lokal</a>. Our first instinct was to put everything in one place &amp; one app - local updates, classifieds, jobs, matrimony and more. It worked, till it stopped working.

We encourage a bias for action, innovation, creativity, and courage in everything that we do. We measure ourselves by the quality, credibility and impact we achieve as a result.</p><h3>Different is good.</h3><p>We believe that great minds think differently and building broad coalitions has made us who we are. Making progress on policy requires that we operate outside of the echo chamber and take non-traditional approaches to policy making. We apply this same principle to the way we operate and how we build our teams: with a focus on diversity and inclusion. We are all unique but belong to the same team.</p><h3>Serious(ly)</h3><p>We’re serious about our work, but don’t take ourselves too seriously. We believe in the intellectual rigor, free inquiry and honesty, that is required to achieve our mission, but having fun doing it is equally as important.</p><h3>One Team</h3><p>We all work together and work with humility. We strive to cultivate trust and transparency at all levels, between ourselves as individuals and as an organization, with our stakeholders, and in our work. We demonstrate respect and openness in our actions at all times. We are all unique but belong to the same team.</p><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

      "description": "<h3>The Opportunity: Be The Active Copilot</h3><p>This is a high-impact leadership role for a <strong>product leader</strong> who wants to operate at <strong>GM altitude</strong>.</p><p>You will serve as the <strong>strategic co-pilot</strong> to the President of our Manufacturing ERP business during a period of major transformation—cloud modernization, go-to-market acceleration, and an AI-native product shift. This is <strong>not</strong> an observer role. You will sit in decision rooms, drive strategy artifacts, unblock execution, and own outcomes.</p><h3>Who You Are</h3><p>You are a product thinker at heart. You have managed roadmaps, wrestled with prioritization, and shipped features. Now, you want to zoom out. You possess <strong>insatiable intellectual curiosity.</strong> You are the person who reads white papers on weekends, tests new AI tools for fun, and constantly asks, \"Why do we do it this way?\"</p><p><strong>This is not a traditional PMO / Program Manager role.</strong></p><p>You are expected to have product judgment and be able to make calls. You will be accountable for strategy outputs and business results, not meeting coordination.</p><h3>The Core Mission</h3><p>Your primary mandate is to operationalize the President's vision. You will bring \"Product Thinking\" to the business itself. You will treat the organization as a system that needs to be optimized, debugged, and scaled.</p><h3>Key Responsibilities</h3><p><strong>1.From Reactive to Proactive (The System Architect)</strong></p><ul><li><h3>Drive the strategy operating system”</h3><ul><li><p>Define &amp; maintain the <strong>strategy stack</strong>: Narrative → Customer segmentation → Portfolio bets → Roadmap → Metrics → Commercial model</p></li><li><p>Own the <strong>monthly strategy review</strong>: tradeoff decisions, kill lists, acceleration decisions</p></li><li><p>Drive <strong>product portfolio governance </strong>(what gets built vs stopped)</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Predictive Intelligence: </strong>Instead of waiting for the P&amp;L to show a problem, you will build \"early warning systems\" using leading indicators in pipeline, usage data, and sentiment. This allows us to course-correct months in advance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cross-BU Alignment: </strong>We operate within a larger enterprise. You will manage the diplomacy and connection points with other Business Units to ensure we leverage shared resources and do not reinvent the wheel.</p></li></ul><h3> 2. Strategic Force Multiplier (The Copilot)</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Proxy &amp; Decision Making: </strong>You will sit in for the President in critical meetings with the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) and cross-functional peers. You are empowered to make decisions, not just take notes.</p></li><li><p><strong>The \"Unblocker\": </strong>Transformation creates friction. You will identify where the business is stuck. Whether it is a stalled product launch, a sales-enablement gap, or a hiring bottleneck, you will deploy the resources needed to clear the path.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sounding Board: </strong>You provide a safe, intellectual space for the President to stress-test ideas. You challenge assumptions with data and \"Product Sense\" before strategies are rolled out to the wider team.</p></li></ul><h3>3. Efficiency &amp; Innovation (The Modernizer)</h3><ul><li><p><strong>AI &amp; Operational Leverage: </strong>You are intellectually curious and tech-savvy. You will lead the charge on integrating AI and automation across to increase velocity in all areas of the business.</p></li><li><p><strong>Information Architecture: </strong>You ensure the President is the best-informed person in the room by synthesizing complex data from all components of the business unit into clear and actionable insights.</p></li></ul><h3>The \"Product Sense\" We Need</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Strategy over Tactics: </strong>You do not just execute tasks. You understand why the task matters to the customer and the bottom line.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customer Centricity: </strong>Even though this is an internal role, you obsess over the \"Customer Experience\" of the employees and stakeholders interacting with the President’s office.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prioritization: </strong>You ruthlessly prioritize the President’s focus using frameworks like RICE to ensure we are working on the highest-value transformation levers.</p></li></ul><h3>The Ideal Candidate</h3><h3>Experience:</h3><ul><li><p>7+ years in product management / product operations &amp; strategy</p></li><li><p>Former <strong>Group PM / Director PM / Head of Product</strong></p></li><li><p>Has <strong>owned roadmap + shipped + carried a business number</strong></p></li><li><p>Has worked with GTM and knows adoption + monetization</p></li></ul><h3>First 90 Days (How you will win)</h3><ul><li><p>30 days: learn the terrain, map constraints, define the portfolio, stand up the decision dashboard</p></li><li><p>60 days: launch 2 force-multiplier programs (Product Operation / Product maturity model implementation + AI adoption/attach system)</p></li><li><p>90 days: show measurable improvement in throughput + decision speed + execution predictability</p></li></ul><h3>Not a Fit If…</h3><ul><li><p>You’re primarily a program manager / meeting runner</p></li><li><p>You have not owned product outcomes or roadmap tradeoffs</p></li><li><p>You avoid conflict-driven prioritization (“saying no” is part of the job)</p></li></ul><p><strong>AI-First Product Mindset:</strong><br>You understand what it means to build in an AI-native world—not just bolt AI onto legacy workflows. You know how to:</p><ul><li><p>Identify where machine intelligence can remove toil, accelerate workflows, or change user behavior.</p></li><li><p>Work with LLMs, agents, embeddings, retrieval systems, and automation patterns at a conceptual level.</p></li><li><p>Design products that blend <strong>predictive, prescriptive, and agentic</strong> intelligence into the core experience, not as an afterthought.</p></li><li><p>Validate AI use cases through experiments, data, and fast feedback loops.</p></li><li><p>Apply judgment around AI feasibility, guardrails, hallucination mitigation, and responsible deployment.</p></li><li><p>Translate ambiguous AI opportunities into clear problem definitions and measurable value.</p></li><li><p>create agent success metrics (deflection, cycle time reduction, OTIF uplift, etc.)</p></li></ul><p>You don’t need to be an ML engineer, but you must understand AI deeply enough to make intelligent product decisions, challenge engineering teams, and see second-order effects ahead of others.</p><p><strong>Domain Aptitude:</strong><br>You have an affinity for complex B2B ecosystems like ERP, Supply Chain, or Manufacturing. You enjoy the intellectual challenge of “hard” industries where constraints, edge cases, and real-world operations matter.</p><p><strong>High Agency:</strong><br>You see a problem and own the solution. You act with urgency. You do not wait for permission to fix a broken process or to propose a better way.</p><p><strong>Transformation Warrior:</strong><br>You are comfortable with ambiguity and energized by environments where the playbook is being written in real time. You bring structure to chaos and clarity to complexity.</p><p><strong>Overcommunicator:</strong><br>You leave nothing to guess. You communicate consistently, proactively, and translate across functions—engineering, sales, services, marketing, finance—with precision.</p><p><strong>Strategic Mobility (Travel):</strong><br>You understand that transformation cannot be run from behind a desk. You are willing to travel (30%) to spend time with customers, shadow field teams, support leadership offsites, and anchor strategy in live ground truth.</p><ul><li>Your health and well being are important to us at QAD. We provide programs that help you strike a healthy work-life balance.</li><li>Opportunity to join a growing business, launching into its next phase of expansion and transformation.</li><li>Collaborative culture of smart and hard-working people who support one another to get the job done.</li><li>An atmosphere of growth and opportunity, where idea-sharing is always prioritized over level or hierarchy.</li></ul><h3>COMPENSATION PACKAGE:</h3><ul><li>Base pay range: $140,000.00 - $160,000.00 USD Annual (12 Months) </li><li><p>This position is also eligible for the annual company bonus.</p></li><li>Placement within our pay range will vary based on knowledge, skills, experience, and market location variations as well as internal peer equity</li><li>U.S. benefits package includes medical, dental and vision coverage, a 401(k) plan with company match, short-term and long-term disability coverage, life insurance, paid-time off, parental leave, and well-being programs</li></ul><h3>About QAD:</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.qad.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">QAD</a> | <a href=\"https://rzsoftware.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Redzone</a> is redefining manufacturing and supply chains through its intelligent, adaptive platform that connects people, processes, and data into a single System of Action.

In the same way, the <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/california-iso\">California ISO</a> operates independently—managing the electron traffic on a power grid we do not own—making sure electricity is safely delivered to utilities and consumers on time and reliably.</p><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

The CPO’s mandate will be to raise standards, coach, focus and operationalise multi-squad, cross-functional performance, without expanding headcount unnecessarily.</p><p>This is not a blank-sheet transformation role; MBA’s Product and Engineering squads, rituals and foundations are already in place. The CPO will work to accelerate momentum, delivering meaningful improvements to conversion, experience quality and Product Marketing capability.</p><h3>Requirements</h3><h3>Who we're looking for</h3><p>We're looking for someone with a track record of successfully leading product and growth in fast-growth environments:</p><h3>Strategic &amp; Commercial Leadership:</h3><p>Candidates with existing consumer marketplace or eCommerce scale-up experience will bring an immediate advantage to this role. Able to pair Product with Commercial, the CPO will translate ambitious commercial targets into a focused, insight-led product strategy and sequenced roadmap. MBA is an environment rich with ideas. The ordering and execution of these will be vital to the business’s success.</p><h3>Product Craft &amp; Execution Excellence:</h3><p>The strongest candidates will have a track record of delivering beautifully executed digital experiences, across UX, interaction design, brand expression and product marketing. Driving standards across the team, the CPO will set a high bar to product quality while operationalising cross-functional, outcome-oriented working models that drive measurable impact. Blending product intuition with quantitative insight and user empathy, the CPO will prioritise based on first principles and orchestrate high- quality execution across the entire product lifecycle.</p><h3>Product Marketing, Growth &amp; User Experience: </h3><p>This executive will bring strong product marketing intuition and an understanding of how to nurture users through thoughtfully designed experiences that reduce friction, improve conversion and drive repeat behaviour. They will identify the moments where MBA’s offerings can both attract and retain users, building growth loops that reduce over-reliance on marketing channels alone.</p><h3>Technical &amp; Mobile Capability: </h3><p>Candidates who possess practical experience in developing, launching and growing mobile applications - ideally zero-to-one - paired with credible technical judgement and fluency in modern product development environments, including hybrid or React Native architectures, will hit the ground running. Beyond, the CPO will need to operate hand-in-glove with engineering leadership, ensuring alignment, respectful challenge and shared ownership of outcomes across cross-functional squads.</p><h3>People Leadership &amp; Coaching:</h3><p>As an exceptional manager and coach, the CPO will develop the Product team by encouraging ever-increasing autonomy, product judgment, decision-making capability and design quality. They provide stability, direction and clarity while protecting and enhancing MBA’s existing low-ego, mission-driven culture. Leadership style should be grounded in empowerment, ownership, targeted feedback and high standards, enabling teams to mature, operate independently and deliver consistently stronger insights, briefs and Product outcomes over time.</p><h3>Benefits<p></p><p><strong>What we offer</strong></p></h3><ul><li><strong>38 days holiday per year (including public holidays)</strong></li><li><strong>Competitive package based on your experience and UK benchmarks</strong></li><li><strong>Fully remote and flexible working</strong></li><li><strong>A free MBA trip in your first year</strong></li><li><strong>30% employee discount + 15% friends &amp; family discount on trips</strong></li><li><strong>Generous pension scheme (UK only)</strong></li><li><strong>Free private GP access and unlimited mental health support via BHSF</strong></li><li><strong>Budget for home office setup or co-working space</strong></li><li><strong>16 weeks fully paid parental leave (primary caregiver) or 4 weeks (secondary caregiver)</strong></li><li><strong>Regular team meetups and adventures</strong></li></ul><p><strong><strong>Application</strong><br>We’re an equal opportunities employer and we welcome applicants from all backgrounds.
