This is not a legacy law firm. This is a rocket ship, and we’re assembling the team that will take it to the next level.</p><p style=\"font-family:\">If you thrive in fast-moving environments, love taking ownership and being held accountable, and want to be part of something you can help shape, not just maintain, you’ll feel right at home here.</p><hr><h3>Our Story</h3><p style=\"font-family:\">TopDog Law is not your typical law firm. We believe that world-class marketing, paired with exceptional legal talent and operations, creates better experiences and outcomes for clients and the business alike.</p><p style=\"font-family:\">Over the past three years, we’ve grown 2–3x year over year, setting a new standard on the marketing side of the personal injury space and proving what’s possible when strategy, speed, and execution align. Now, we’re applying that same discipline and innovation to law firm operations, case management, and execution as we scale nationally and fully integrate.</p><p style=\"font-family:\">We are intentionally building the infrastructure, systems, and teams needed to scale at a national level—without sacrificing quality, culture, or accountability. This is still the early stage of that journey, which means the people who join now have a real opportunity to help shape how the firm operates for years to come.</p><h3>Who Thrives Here</h3><p style=\"font-family:\">We don’t hire based on resumes alone.

Language models alone won’t solve the world’s hardest problems – robotics, disease, scientific discovery. Real progress requires models that experience the world and learn from their mistakes, the same way that humans do. And this kind of trial and error can be massively accelerated when done in simulation, rather than in the real world.<br><br>World models offer the most clear path to general-purpose simulation, changing how stories are told, how scientific progress is made and how the next frontiers of humanity are reached.</p><p class=\"p1\">Our team consists of creative, open minded, caring and ambitious people who are determined to change the world. We aspire to continuously build impossible things and our ability to do so relies on building an incredible team.

TASTE is a startup, so there are no set rules nor procedures. We don’t need a coffee-fetcher. What we are seeking are people who are hungry to share epic, yet intimate stories with the world; who have the creative ability to think nimbly and unconventionally; and who have the wherewithal to take action on their ideas. If you’re the type of person who is self-directed (a.k.a. likes to make their own recipes for getting big projects done), then you should apply.</p><h3>Sample Tasks &amp; Qualifications:</h3><ul><li>Working with restaurants (especially in Manhattan, NY) as we plan and implement in-person TASTE film screenings, premieres, dinners, performances and events——what we like to call “TASTE: Film-to-Table” Events.<br>- Research and source archival footage and other media footage from independent creators, filmmakers, governments, archival institutions, media companies and more.<br>- Help recruit creative talent for TASTE: filmmakers, editors, producers, composers, etc.<br>Researching and reaching out to potential investors, networks, media outlets, sponsors, stakeholders, clients, collaborators, media and press.<br>- Applicants should have a high attention to detail and be organized, motivated, and self-directed (this is essential!)</li>\n</ul><h3>- Value doers over talkers.</h3><ul><li>Accountable and eager to learn, grow and create with a fast-moving team.<br>- An understanding that the filmmaking and startup process is a team sport that takes time &amp; dedication.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Flexible location and times.</strong> The entire internship will be done remotely with flexible deadlines and work hours that will fit within your schedule. As long as an intern is making progress on his/her projects and putting in 100% effort, then we will make sure that project work hours and deadlines will be flexible according to the intern's schedule.</p><ul><li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></li>\n</ul><p>In order for your application to be read and considered, it is <strong>required</strong> to fill out this form: https://bit.ly/3fz4rh7</p><p><strong>All applicants who fail to fill out this form will NOT proceed to the interview selection round.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, due to the volume of applications we receive, we aren’t able to contact all candidates who apply, but if you are invited for an interview, you will generally be contacted within 4 weeks of submitting your application.</p><p>Thank you for your interest in working with us.
