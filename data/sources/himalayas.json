We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live streams, events, chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under their own brand.</p><p>We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and growing!) team members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn, create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones, are highly async, and like to document a lot.</p><p>Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around the world for our company offsites. So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey, Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still more to come!</p><p>Check out our <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://careers.circle.so/\" data-stringify-link=\"https://careers.circle.so/\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Careers</a> page for more about working at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/circle\">Circle</a>.</p></div><h3>About the role</h3><p>We're hiring a Video Editor to join <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/circle\">Circle</a>'s Design Studio. You'll own the editorial backbone of our video production pipeline, turning raw footage into finished stories that build trust with professional audiences.</p><p>This role is focused and high taste. Our video producers handle pre-production, scripting, and recording. Our animator handles motion graphics and UI sequences. <strong>You own the edit:</strong> finding the story in messy raw material, shaping the narrative, setting pacing, and delivering a locked cut ready for animation. After animation is complete, the project comes back to you for color, audio, and final delivery.</p><p>We work in two lanes: <strong>Brand videos</strong> are high polish projects like product launches, customer stories, and keynotes. <strong>Growth videos</strong> move faster: YouTube content, educational tutorials, paid ads, and social campaigns. Your job is to recognize which lane you're in and calibrate accordingly, without losing the standard.</p><p>We're not trying to look \"pretty.\" We're trying to look inevitable. Clear. Premium. Like a company you'd trust with serious money and serious attention.</p><h3><strong>Types of projects</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Customer stories:</strong> 60 to 90 second testimonials showing transformation and outcomes</li><li><strong>Product launches:</strong> 3 to 5 minute feature announcements, deep dives, and releases</li><li><strong>YouTube content:</strong> educational videos, thought leadership, and tutorials</li><li><strong>Paid ads:</strong> performance-optimized creative for Meta, YouTube, and LinkedIn</li><li><strong>Keynote presentations:</strong> high-stakes founder presentations and virtual productions</li><li><strong>Brand videos:</strong> premium positioning pieces that elevate our market presence</li></ul><h3>What you’ll be doing</h3><ul><li>Shape narratives from raw footage (interviews, host segments, product demos, screen recordings)</li><li>Build structure, pacing, and emotional rhythm, not just \"tight edits\"</li><li>Deliver locked cuts with final timing and structure before animation begins</li><li>Coordinate handoffs with our animator to ensure smooth integration</li><li>Color grade in DaVinci Resolve to maintain a consistent, premium look across projects</li><li>Mix audio for platform-ready delivery (clean dialogue, balanced music, controlled dynamics)</li><li>Manage project files with clear naming, version control, and clean handoffs</li><li>Finalize videos after animation and deliver exports across all channels</li><li>Create social media cutdowns from bigger projects (short clips, vertical versions, alternate hooks) to keep the marketing calendar full when we have momentum</li></ul><h3>What you'll need to be successful</h3><ul><li>Strong alignment with our values, <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/<a href='https://himalayas.app/companies/circle'>Circle</a>-Careers-223a15ea312c4922b793593d07add7fe?pvs=21\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">find our values on our career page</a> if you haven’t read up on them yet.</li><li>Proficiency in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a CEFR Level C2 / ILR Level 5</li><li><strong>3 to 6 years of professional editing experience</strong>, ideally for software or technology companies serving professional audiences.</li><li><strong>Strong narrative instincts</strong>. You can pull a clean arc out of a long interview. You know what to cut, what to keep, and when to let a moment breathe. Your portfolio should show work where the edit is doing real work, not just assembling pre-planned shots.</li><li><strong>Taste and restraint.</strong> You know when effects help and when they cheapen. You can make something feel expensive with fewer moves, not more.</li><li><strong>A \"high trust\" operator.</strong> <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/circle\">Circle</a> gives you real autonomy. You get to make decisions, own your projects, and do your best work with the freedom to explore creative solutions. You care deeply about the brand’s integrity, you take feedback well, you're excited to figure things out, and you ship work you're genuinely proud of.</li><li><strong>Initiative.</strong> When a product launch or keynote drops, you see the angles. You pull the best moments, propose cutdowns, and make hay while the sun shines. You don't wait to be asked to create the obvious follow-ups or social media cutdowns.</li></ul><h3><strong>Technical range</strong></h3><ul><li>Advanced Premiere Pro or Davinci Resolve editing</li><li>Solid DaVinci Resolve for color grading</li><li>Working knowledge of After Effects for basic compositing and cleanup (not motion design)</li><li>Comfortable using Figma for storyboarding</li><li>Comfortable using AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, Nano Banana to speed up workflows</li><li>Comfortable with Notion, Frame.io, Dropbox, and Descript</li><li>Experience with modern caption styles and clean text animation</li></ul><p><strong>A reliable setup.</strong> High speed internet (50+ Mbps upload), professional audio monitoring, and a color-accurate display.</p><p><strong>Strong process habits.</strong> You keep timelines organized, label and version cleanly, protect the project as it evolves, and flag problems early.</p><h3><strong>Our Visual Style</strong></h3><p>We're evolving toward a minimal, professional aesthetic. Intentional pacing that gives viewers space to absorb information. Captions placed with purpose, protecting eye line and keeping attention on the subject. Soft, seamless transitions. Subtle glows and gradients when they earn their place. Professional, consistent color across every project.</p><p>We make videos for professionals making serious decisions. Clarity and credibility matter more than flash or spice.</p><h3><strong>How to succeed in this role</strong></h3><p><strong>Story first, always.</strong> When you receive a 45 minute interview, start with the transcript. Find the three to five moments that matter. Know your arc before you touch the timeline.</p><p><strong>Communicate as you go.</strong> Share rough thinking early. Ask questions when the brief is unclear. Keep collaborators in the loop. The best work happens when there are fewer surprises.</p><p><strong>Be organized.</strong> Between customer stories, product launches, and ad campaigns, we generate a lot of footage and assets. Your job is to keep the system clean: bins, versions, naming, exports, and syncing across cloud drives. If someone needs to pick up your project, they should be able to find everything fast.</p><p><strong>Live and breathe <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/circle\">Circle</a>'s brand.</strong> You will be editing dozens of videos across every part of our business. Over time, you should internalize our visual language: how we pace, how we use color, how we position text, what kind of music we choose. Watch our published work. Study it. Ask questions about why we made certain choices. The best editors on our team become extensions of the brand itself, making instinctive decisions that feel unmistakably <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/circle\">Circle</a>.</p><h3><strong>Who you will work with</strong></h3><p>You'll work closely with our Video Producers, who provide footage and creative direction. You'll hand off locked cuts to our Animator and collaborate on integration. You'll receive feedback from Marketing, the Design Studio, and <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/circle\">Circle</a> founders during reviews. You report to the Head of Design Studio.</p><h3>$85,000 - $105,000 USD per year</h3><p><em>The cash compensation range shown is a starting point.
