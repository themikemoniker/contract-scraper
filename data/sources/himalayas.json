Clarke famously said that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”</p><p>At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/mercury\">Mercury</a>, we aim to deliver a magical experience to our customers who rely on us for their banking* and financial workflows. But behind the magic lies a lot of rigor—risk management is a key part of keeping <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/mercury\">Mercury</a> safe, resilient, and worthy of our customers’ trust.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/mercury\">Mercury</a>’s first Chief Risk Officer, you’ll set the vision for risk at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/mercury\">Mercury</a>. You’ll build and lead the program that measures, monitors, and manages credit, market, financial, and operational risks across the company. You’ll partner with our Board and Risk Committee to define <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/mercury\">Mercury</a>’s risk culture, appetite, and limits—and make sure the way we operate every day stays aligned with those standards.</p><p><em>*<a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/mercury\">Mercury</a> is a fintech company, not an FDIC-insured bank. Banking services provided through Choice Financial Group and Column N.A., Members FDIC.</em></p><h3>Here are some of the things you will do:</h3><ul><li>Set the vision for risk at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/mercury\">Mercury</a> — define and lead our enterprise-wide risk strategy and framework.</li><li>Safeguard our platform — ensure customer data and technology assets are protected, with clear and regular communication to the Board.</li><li>Look around corners — identify emerging risks, especially those tied to new products, services, and markets, and help teams navigate them.</li><li>Keep us aligned — make sure our strategies and operations stay in step with laws, regulations, and regulatory expectations.</li><li>Build systems that scale — design and implement processes to consistently identify, assess, measure, monitor, and report risks across the company.</li><li>Translate complexity into clarity — partner with business leaders to turn risk topics into actionable insights that guide smart decisions.</li><li>Strengthen accountability — support our audit programs, ensure findings are addressed, and embed improvements into how we work.</li><li>Represent risk at the highest level — serve as the primary point of communication on risk with the <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/mercury\">Mercury</a> Board and its Risk Committee.</li></ul><p>There are lots of paths that could lead you to be successful in a role like this; we think the strongest candidates will have some of these experiences or attributes:</p><ul><li>Bring proven leadership in risk management — you’ve built or scaled enterprise risk programs in banking or financial services, ideally at the intersection of traditional finance and fintech innovation.</li><li>Have breadth and depth across risk disciplines — from credit and market risks to liquidity and operations, you can see the connections between them and design frameworks that work in practice, not just on paper.</li><li>Navigate the regulatory landscape with confidence — you know what regulators expect, you’re comfortable engaging directly with them, and you can help <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/mercury\">Mercury</a> anticipate and adapt to a changing environment.</li><li>Communicate clearly and simply — whether you’re talking to the Board, regulators, engineers, or product teams, you cut through jargon and make risk concepts understandable and actionable.</li><li>Balance protection with possibility — you know how to safeguard the company without slowing it down, and you see risk management as a way to unlock innovation, not just prevent downside.</li><li>Lead with curiosity and vision — you’re ambitious about where risk management can go in a modern fintech, and you bring the curiosity to explore new ideas, new markets, and new ways of serving customers safely. </li><li>Inspire and develop others — you build strong teams, mentor future leaders, and foster a culture of accountability, transparency, and trust across the company. </li></ul><p>The total rewards package at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/mercury\">Mercury</a> includes base salary, equity (stock options/RSUs), and benefits.</p><p>Our salary and equity ranges are highly competitive within the SaaS and fintech industry and are updated regularly using the most reliable compensation survey data for our industry.

Most of the current pharmaceuticals only offer a one size fits all approach and often come with unwanted and potentially dangerous side effects. We found that through compounding we can offer a much more personalized solution to medicine.</p><p>Through this we have been able to help patients get the results they are seeking for their personal needs. After years of working for corporate chains we took the risk and opened <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/strive-pharmacy\">Strive Pharmacy</a>. We are dedicated to providing a better experience for each customer and clinic that we work with. Come see the Strive difference.</p><h3><strong>Our Mission</strong></h3><p><strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\">We’re flipping the script with personal medicine. </strong>We strive to interrupt an industry that has been closed to personalized care, accessibility, and nuance for too long. We strive to shift a reactive view of self-care and ignite a proactive baseline-shifting approach to health for all. ‘The human element’ is our crux and catalyst, driving all that we do, whether we’re interacting with patients, providers, or practices. We’re here to partner with those ready for a change. More than a compounding pharmacy, we’re on a mission to positively disrupt healthcare as we know it. Strive is about more than medicine. Strive is about striving for the personal side of healthcare.</p></div><h3>Visa Sponsorship is not offered.</h3><p>Location: Preferably in the Greater Salt Lake City/ Provo/ Ogden UT area OR the Greater Mesa/ Greater Phoenix AZ area.

Join us in making hourly work rewarding and fulfilling.</p><h3>BACKGROUND AND OPPORTUNITY </h3><p>There are almost 75 million hourly workers in the United States, representing more than half of the entire workforce. Historically, managing hourly employees has been difficult due to high attrition (average of 60%) and high replacement costs (average of $3,200 per employee in retail). The ongoing labor shortage and competition from the gig-economy, make it more difficult to attract and retain hourly employees.The top reasons hourly employees leave their jobs are a lack of schedule empowerment, poor communication with employers, and an inability to get paid early. Gen Z and the millennial workforce demand gig-like flexibility, modern technology, and compelling work options.<a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/legion\">Legion</a>’s mission is to turn hourly jobs into good jobs, serving the hourly workers who make up the majority of the US workforce. We believe in empowering employees and helping employers be efficient and innovative by enabling intelligent automation powered by <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/legion\">Legion</a>’s Workforce Management platform to optimize labor efficiency and enhance the employee experience simultaneously. <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/legion\">Legion</a> WFM was built for the cloud with AI at the core and designed to handle the complexity of modern businesses and meet the needs of today’s hourly employees. Our team is comprised of dedicated individuals from all backgrounds and experiences, globally distributed across all time zones.</p><p>For more information, visit <a href=\"https://legion.co\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://legion.co</a></p><h3>EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY</h3><p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/legion\">Legion</a> Technologies is proud to be an equal opportunity employer and is committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive work environment.
