Our team thrives on that energy. When we’re not helping clients deliver business-critical outcomes, we’re refining our craft and celebrating what it means to do hard things well.</p><p style=\"line-height:1.8;margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;\">We’ve built a collaborative, tight-knit culture that thrives in both remote and in-person settings. We’ve won numerous workplace awards over the years, including Great Place to Work certification and recognition from Parity.org as a Best Company for Women to Advance.</p><p style=\"line-height:1.8;margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;\">Our clients include well-known brands like Vizio, Peloton, Clear, iHeart Radio, and Fellowes — all determined to leverage connected devices and AI to drive meaningful impact. Our job is simple: help them win.</p><hr><h3>About This Role</h3><p style=\"line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;\">As a Senior Level Software Engineer, you’ll play a key role in building and maintaining secure, scalable applications that support critical customer and business needs. You’ll work across the stack — from designing backend services to implementing front-end features while collaborating closely with cross-functional teams.</p><p style=\"line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;\">This role is hands-on: you’ll translate requirements into well-designed solutions, write production-ready code, participate in code reviews, and contribute to the overall reliability and performance of our systems. You’ll also help support our applications in production through on-call rotations and proactive issue resolution.</p><p style=\"line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;\">This position is ideal for an engineer who enjoys solving real-world problems, working in modern cloud environments, and contributing to systems end-to-end. You’ll have the opportunity to deepen your technical expertise, influence design decisions, and grow within a supportive engineering culture.</p><p style=\"line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;\">At Very the key distinction between mid, senior and lead roles is the scope and depth of your expertise and responsibility. As a mid you can own and deliver tasks (work packages) with a high level of professionalism and know when to reach out for help. As a senior, you have deep expertise in your area of specialization and can execute independently in your domain while interfacing with other software stacks. As a lead you become a true full stack engineer with the ability to plan, execute and lead a team across the full software stack, while interfacing with non-software aspects of the project.</p><p style=\"line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;\">This is not an easy role. You’ll work in complex domains, under real deadlines, and with clients who expect you to bring clarity, confidence, and results. If you find satisfaction in doing hard things well — in solving tough problems, building real systems, and helping others rise to the challenge — you’ll fit right in.</p><p style=\"line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;\">As a client services organization, travel may be required up to 10% of the time. Some clients may also require periodic assignment to 24/7 support rotation.</p><hr><h3>What You’ll Be Working On</h3><p style=\"line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:16px;\">Every engagement at Very is different, but they share one common theme: we build things that matter. From connected hardware and data systems to large-scale web and AI-driven platforms, you’ll:</p><ul><li style=\"list-style-type:disc;\">Capture technical requirements and contribute to high-level and low-level design for software solutions using AWS and Azure technologies.</li><li style=\"list-style-type:disc;\">Write production-grade Java, Python, and SQL code that meets high standards for

standards, and delivers measurable business value.</li><li style=\"list-style-type:disc;\">Strengthen System Reliability: Improve observability, performance, and operational excellence across services and components.</li><li style=\"list-style-type:disc;\">Support Cross-Functional Delivery: Collaborate effectively with lead engineers, designers, PMs, and client stakeholders.</li><li

You'll be teaching Python developers how to use AI tools effectively in their day-to-day work.</p><h3>Requirements<p></p><p><strong>You should:</strong></p></h3><ul><li><strong>Have several years of <strong>Python development experience</strong> under your belt</strong></li><li><strong>Have extensive <strong>hands-on experience using AI tools </strong>in your Python work (this could include coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or Cursor, working with LLM APIs like OpenAI or Anthropic, or other AI-powered development tools)</strong></li><li><strong>Be able to <strong>teach practical skills</strong>: how to write effective prompts, validate AI-generated code, integrate AI into workflows, and understand limitations</strong></li><li><strong>Are comfortable making <strong>clear recommendations, grounded in experience</strong>, about how and when Python developers should use AI tools.</strong></li><li><strong>Be ready to grow as a writer and work on your <strong>writing skills</strong></strong></li><li><strong>Be comfortable <strong>learning brand new topics</strong> that you have never done before, which are either not documented or poorly documented</strong></li><li><strong><strong>Have the time</strong> to make <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/real-python\">Real Python</a> a regular part of your week – this will be a <strong>significant time commitment</strong> and is not easy</strong></li></ul><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong> We're looking for writers who are <strong>actively using AI in their Python development work</strong>. If you can help Python developers understand how to work with AI tools, you're who we're looking for.</strong></p><h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3><p><strong><strong>There are plenty of perks to being on the <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/real-python\">Real Python</a> team:</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Learning:</strong> You'll always be learning something new – and you'll have fun doing it. You'll become a better developer, writer, and communicator, while making new friends along the way.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Eyeballs: </strong>Our site gets a lot of traffic – over 3 million visitors per month and growing. We're regularly featured in other Python publications and we also run one of the largest email newsletters and social media accounts in the community. When you publish a tutorial here, it will get read a lot, and people will love you for it.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Tutorial Polish: </strong>When you submit a tutorial or article to realpython.com, we will personally work with you to polish your work to a high level of quality. In the end, your tutorial will look much better than when you first submitted it, making you look really good.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Writing Training: </strong>When we are done reviewing and editing your tutorial, we will send you detailed feedback on how you can improve your tutorials in the future. This will help you become a better developer, writer, and communicator.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Personal Exposure: </strong>Your picture and bio will be prominently featured on your tutorials and on multiple other places on the site. This can lead to a multitude of new opportunities for you – job offers, freelance projects, and conference invitations. An in-depth tutorial published on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/real-python\">Real Python</a> can make a great portfolio piece.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Get Paid to Learn: </strong>You'll get paid to learn. We're not asking you to do this \"just for the exposure\" – this is a paid part-time position.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Special Opportunities:</strong> Members of the tutorial team get access to special opportunities such as contributing to our books and courses, speaking at online meetups we organize, becoming interview guests to chat about an area of your expertise on the <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/real-python\">Real Python</a> Podcast, working on team projects, and more.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>You'll Have an Impact: </strong>We get emails and comments every day about how our tutorials help our readers write their first Python program, get their learning progress unstuck, or accomplish their career dream of working with Python professionally. This means a lot to us and makes all the hard work worth it. Our most prolific authors have been approached at conferences and meetups by other developers who read their articles – a great conversation starter.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>100% Remote-Friendly: </strong>At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/real-python\">Real Python</a> you'll join a remote-first, distributed, and diverse team that spans across the globe.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>Free Stuff: </strong>As a final bonus, by joining the tutorial team you will get a lot of free stuff. You'll get a free copy of all of the products we sell on the site, access to all of our members-only content, as well as a life-time membership to PythonistaCafe. That's about $1,000 in value you'll receive for free.</strong></p><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

Our culture runs on three values: better together, relentlessly curious, and get sh*t done. It is how we work, how we grow, and how we make things that matter.</p><p>At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/dept\">DEPT®</a>, you will find the freedom to explore, the space to collaborate, and the trust to make a real impact for our clients, for each other, and for the world we are helping to build.</p><h3>THE ROLE:</h3><p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/dept\">DEPT®</a> is looking for an Associate Director, Growth Marketing, Americas, who treats marketing as part of the commercial engine, not a separate function. Someone who can connect marketing, sales, CRM, data, and AI into one system – and prove it in Salesforce.</p><h3>You’ll:</h3><ul><li>Take our Americas growth plan and turn it into a working, measurable growth machine.</li><li>Focus less on filling the top of the funnel and more on creating and accelerating opportunities with the right accounts.</li><li>Work with a lean budget, using smart targeting, content, CRM, partners, and events rather than relying on massive paid demand.</li></ul><p>You’ll report to the VP, Marketing, Americas.</p><h3>WHAT YOU’LL DO:</h3><p><strong>Integrated Growth Strategy:</strong> Design and implement a marketing strategy that connects all the dots – aligning marketing, sales, CRM, data, and AI into a single pipeline engine driving qualified opportunities.</p><p><strong>Execute the Growth Plan: </strong>Activate <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/dept\">DEPT®</a>’s Americas growth plan. Target our ideal customer profiles in key verticals and use strategic partnerships and events to convert high-value prospects into our pipeline.</p><p><strong>Break Down Silos: </strong>Work closely with sales and client teams to ensure marketing and business development operate in sync, sharing insights and aligning on goals instead of working in silos.</p><p><strong>Build Relationships:</strong> Nurture relationships with prospective clients and partners through content, events, and personal outreach – turning trust and engagement into tangible new business opportunities.</p><p><strong>Data-Driven Optimization: </strong>Leverage our tech stack (Salesforce, Pardot, and InfiniGrow) to track performance and optimize marketing investments around revenue goals. You’ll monitor what’s working, double down on the best channels, and pivot quickly based on data insights.</p><p><strong>Scrappy Demand Generation: </strong>Drive demand with creative, high-impact tactics rather than big budgets – think thought leadership content, targeted campaigns, smart automation, and ABM, all designed to deliver results without heavy paid spend.</p><h3>WHAT YOU BRING:</h3><h3><strong>Experience &amp; Expertise</strong></h3><ul><li>7–10+ years in growth, demand, or performance marketing in B2B (ideally tech, SaaS, digital, or consulting).</li><li>You’ve owned a number (pipeline and/or revenue) and can show how your work moved it, not just how many MQLs you generated.</li><li>Proven track record of turning strategy into execution – building integrated programs that connect campaigns, CRM, content, partners, and sales into one system that converts.</li><li>Hands-on with Salesforce and Pardot for CRM and marketing automation, plus Infinigrow (or similar) for planning and measuring what actually drives revenue.</li><li>Strong grasp of paid media and ABM (especially LinkedIn and targeted syndication), but you don’t rely on big budgets to make an impact.</li><li>Deep experience with pipeline analytics, forecasting, and attribution – you know how to read the numbers and the limits of the models.</li><li>Practical experience using AI in workflows – for research, targeting, personalisation, creative variations, and outreach – with a clear view of where it improves conversion or speed.</li><li>Experience working across functions (Sales, Growth, Partnerships, Brand, RevOps) and managing agencies or contractors to drive one coherent GTM, not disconnected activities.</li></ul><h3><strong>Characteristics &amp; Ways of Working</strong></h3><ul><li>You care how opportunities show up in the forecast and constantly test, learn, and refine based on results.</li><li>You naturally break down silos between marketing, sales, CRM, and partners, and get people aligned around a simple plan.</li><li>You’re comfortable when things aren’t fully defined and can build structure, priorities, and next steps without waiting for perfect inputs.</li><li>You explain complex ideas simply – in writing, slides, and live – and you’re not afraid to push back when something won’t move the needle.</li><li>You can zoom out to shape strategy and zoom in to help write a sequence, fix a dashboard, or tune a targeting list.</li><li>You know how to build trust, influence, and momentum with distributed teams across time zones.</li><li>You have strong follow-through, attention to detail, and a bias for finishing things and getting them into market rather than endlessly iterating.</li></ul><h3>WHAT DO WE OFFER?</h3><p>We are a collaborative, open-door, best-idea-wins environment that fosters personal and company growth and has fun doing it.
