Since 2011, our mission hasn’t changed — we’re here to stop breaches, and we’ve redefined modern security with the world’s most advanced AI-native platform. We work on large scale distributed systems, processing almost 3 trillion events per day and this traffic is growing daily. Our customers span all industries, and they count on CrowdStrike to keep their businesses running, their communities safe and their lives moving forward. We’re also a mission-driven company. We cultivate a culture that gives every CrowdStriker both the flexibility and autonomy to own their careers. We’re always looking to add talented CrowdStrikers to the team who have limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to our customers, our community and each other.

The future of cybersecurity starts with you.</p><h3>About the Role:</h3><p>As a Sr II (equivalent to Principal elsewhere) Frontend Software Engineer CrowdStrike, you will work with a talented and dedicated team to build and maintain the user interface for the Falcon platform. You will provide a high quality user experience that our customers around the world use 24/7 to protect their systems from the most sophisticated adversaries.</p><p>This team in particular is an integral part of our Graph Systems/Threat Graph architecture which 'bubbles up' views to our customers of any threats to their environment(s) which require their attention. We contribute especially in the area of content management as it pertains to those views, the rules that are applied to threat events being observed, and categorization/classification and routing of different types of threats. This allows customers insight and control over their role in remediation within a single pane of glass unifying data points from many disparate sources.</p><p>Our JavaScript framework is Ember, but if you've used React, Angular, or Vue, you'll feel right at home, and we’ll help you get comfortable with both Ember and our codebase. Since we only support evergreen browsers, we can push the boundaries of what’s possible on the web platform while working with truly massive amounts of data. Our ideal candidates are sensitive to the needs of the users and love to find solutions in a unique and dynamic problem space. </p><p>We provide opportunities to learn new skills, mentor fellow engineers, and contribute to the direction of both the team and the products for which we’re responsible.

It can be based out of Austin Metro or New York City Metro and will likely eventually include 1-3 days in-office per week on average (NYC and Austin office are in development and/or expanding, so workers here will remain fully remote for 1.5-2 years more than likely)</p><h3>About the Team:</h3><p>We are an engineering team on a mission to build an extensible system to streamline content for various detection management capabilities. Our goal is to make it easy for detection engineers to create and manage content using a simple and intuitive interface so they can focus on protecting our customers by authoring effective threat detection and prevention policies.</p><h3>What You’ll Do:</h3><ul><li><p>Lead the product team in creating single page applications in Ember, you’ll remain hands-on with coding while leading the team</p></li><li><p>Leverage your technical expertise to help the team make sound decisions about engineering, product direction, and design</p></li><li><p>Take initiative, build consensus, and help create or update tools that improve your team's development experience</p></li><li><h3>Write automated tests for your code</h3></li><li><p>Collaborate with fellow UX Engineers, Cloud Engineers, UX Designers, UX Writers, Technical Writers, User Researchers, QA Analysts, Product Managers, and others</p></li><li><p>Continually learn about the ever-evolving challenges and complexities of the cybersecurity industry</p></li><li><h3>Have fun solving difficult problems</h3></li></ul><h3>What You’ll Need:</h3><ul><li><p>10+ years of experience in Frontend Software Development with expertise driving UI/UX end to end, i.e. significant Javascript programming with modern MVCs (Angular, React, Vue, Ember or equivalent) and a significant role in design/flows</p></li><li><p>Strong HTML &amp; CSS skills, i.e. experience with CSS pre- or post-processors like Sass or PostCSS, and CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS</p></li><li><p>Experience with testing frameworks, tools and methodologies such as QUnit or Mocha</p></li><li><p>Functional knowledge and interest in developing genuinely accessible interfaces</p></li><li><p>Comfortable with Git or similar version control systems and workflows</p></li><li><p>A desire to work closely with others to deliver quality software and solve problems</p></li></ul><h3>Bonus Points:</h3><ul><li><p>Familiarity with client-side build processes and tools (e.g. Ember CLI, Webpack, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Experience with design collab tools like Figma</p></li><li><p>Experience creating or contributing to open source projects</p></li><li><p>Experience with graphics and visualization tools such as D3 or Three.js</p></li><li><p>Experience with UI performance measurement and optimization</p></li><li><p>Experience with web accessibility testing and support</p></li><li><h3>Familiarity with Amazon Web Services</h3></li><li><h3>Prior experience in cybersecurity</h3></li><li><p>Prior experience building enterprise software as a service</p></li><li><p>Prior experience with content management systems</p></li></ul><h3>#HTF</h3><h3>Benefits of Working at CrowdStrike:</h3><ul><li><p>Market leader in compensation and equity awards</p></li><li><p>Comprehensive physical and mental wellness programs</p></li><li><p>Competitive vacation and holidays for recharge</p></li><li><h3>Paid parental and adoption leaves</h3></li><li><p>Professional development opportunities for all employees regardless of level or role</p></li><li><p>Employee Networks, geographic neighborhood groups, and volunteer opportunities to build connections</p></li><li><p>Vibrant office culture with world class amenities</p></li><li><p>Great Place to Work Certified™ across the globe</p></li></ul><p>CrowdStrike is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

Prototype full AI experiences in Python to validate value and quality before we ship to production. </div><div>4. Own prompts and context engineering: instruction design, context shaping, guardrails, tool/function calling patterns, and output formatting.</div><div>5. Build practical evaluation loops: golden sets, scenario coverage, qualitative rubrics, regressions, and acceptance criteria.</div><div>6. Design the AI user experience: make it clear, trustworthy, and resilient if things go wrong.</div><div>7. Run fast experiments, learn from real outputs and usage data, and iterate quickly.</div><div>8.

We know that what we’re not makes us who we are. And we’re not just another agency. We are people driven by a palpable passion and purpose, felt by our clients from the very first conversation.  </div><div>P10 brings together a team of diverse, remote-only seasoned professionals to deliver exceptional value for our clients.
