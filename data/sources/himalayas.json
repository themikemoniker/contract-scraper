      "description": "<div class=\"content-intro\"><p>Ready to revolutionize healthcare, making it faster and more accessible than ever before? </p><h3>How we started:</h3><p>Founded in 2013 by Dwayne D’Souza, <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/heliosx\">HeliosX</a>was built on a simple but powerful idea: healthcare should be easier to access, faster to receive, and centred around the individual. From day one, we’ve grown without external funding; scaling profitably through technology, disciplined execution, and deep medical expertise. What started as a challenger idea has become one of the most significant healthcare platforms operating globally today.</p><h3>Where we are now:</h3><p>We’ve earned the trust of millions of people worldwide through our top-selling products and well-known brands: MedExpress, Dermatica, ZipHealth, RocketRX, and Levity. A lot of our success is down to having our own pharmacies, manufacturers and products – spearheaded by leading in-house medical teams, researchers and pharmacists.<br><br>In 2025, <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/heliosx\">HeliosX</a> helped treat over 1.7 million patients worldwide. We reached £781m in revenue, delivering +337% year-on-year growth and cementing our position as the clear market leader in the UK. In 2025 our weight-loss treatments helped our patients lose 8.5 million kilograms of excess weight; contributing to an estimated 1,300 fewer cardiac events. That’s not just growth; that’s measurable, life-changing impact at scale.<br><br>We're operating across four markets, with successful launches in Germany and Canada, and growing our reach in the US. </p><h3>Where we’re going:</h3><p>2026 is a step-change year. Our ambition is to reach £1.6bn in revenue, expand from four to eight global markets and significantly broaden our condition and treatment portfolio. Over the coming years, you’ll help shape <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/heliosx\">HeliosX</a> into a truly world-leading healthcare partner; one that combines scale, speed, and clinical rigour to redefine how personalised care is delivered.

The products and systems you help build will play a defining role in enabling this once-in-a-generation technological shift and fueling a new wave of innovation.</p><p>You’ll be joining a small, highly technical, early-stage team working before product-market fit - where every decision matters and nothing is fully defined. You’ll lead the exhilarating process of discovery and iteration that turns cutting-edge privacy and AI research into products that data owners and data scientists actually love to use. You’ll work side by side with a deeply skilled, mission-driven group of engineers and researchers, diving deep into code when needed, defining what success looks like, and driving momentum through uncertainty.</p><p>If you’re the kind of person who gets energized by impossible-sounding problems, thrives when the path isn’t clear, and wants to leave a mark on how the world shares knowledge - this is the place to do it. Bring your grit, your curiosity, and your taste for impact. Let’s build the future of data together.</p><h3>Who you are</h3><p>You’re a builder at heart - someone who doesn’t wait for clarity but creates it. You’ve probably worked in messy, early-stage environments where direction was fuzzy, timelines were tight, and outcomes depended on your ability to turn chaos into momentum. You love digging into complex technical problems, understanding them deeply, and translating them into products that actually work for real users.</p><p>You don’t need a big team or a perfect roadmap to make progress - just a mission that matters and smart people to build with. You’re equally comfortable brainstorming a product vision, debugging a workflow, or jumping into a user call to understand what’s not clicking. </p><p>Most of all, you’re motivated by purpose. You want to use your skills to build something that makes the world more open, fair, and capable of solving its hardest problems.</p><h3>Responsibilities</h3><ul><li>Drive discovery, experimentation, and delivery to take Syft from concept to product-market fit serving passionate users.</li><li>Conduct user research and go-to-market experiments to uncover workflows, pain points, and incentives that guide product direction.</li><li>Collaborate closely with engineers and researchers to define, build, and iterate on deeply technical products that unlock new ways to collaborate on private data.</li><li>Translate complex systems - privacy-preserving computations, federated architectures, LLM connectors, and more - into intuitive user experiences.</li><li>Immerse yourself in the evolving landscape of privacy, AI, and data collaboration to anticipate shifts in technology, incentives, and regulation.</li><li>Roll up your sleeves when speed matters - prototype flows, fix bugs or even code alongside the team to accelerate learning.</li><li>Identify the signals that matter - from activation to retention to mission alignment - and use them to guide iteration.</li><li>Communicate priorities with clarity, aligning a distributed team on near-term execution and long-term mission.</li><li>Champion the voice of our users so our most technical work stays grounded in real human problems.</li><li>Engage with policy and standards communities to ensure privacy-preserving technologies are adopted responsibly.</li><li>Cultivate strategic partnerships with organizations whose data, expertise, or reach can accelerate our mission.</li></ul><h3>Requirements</h3><ul><li>3+ years of product management experience - building or scaling technical products - ideally in environments without a clear playbook.</li><li>Strong technical foundation with proven experience coding and collaborating closely with engineers to ship complex software. Able to reason about distributed systems, privacy technologies, and AI.</li><li>Ability to bridge research and implementation - turning technical possibilities into practical product directions, with a deep curiosity about emerging technologies (i.e. secure computation, RAG, mixture of experts).</li><li>Comfort in the unknown - thrive in ambiguity, create structure, and bring clarity where others see complexity.</li><li>Hands-on with code and tooling - able to read PRs, debug, or prototype ideas to help the team move faster.</li><li>Exceptional communicator - clear in writing and speech, able to align distributed teams and build trust across engineers, researchers, policymakers, and partners.</li><li>Ability to build trusted relationships across diverse stakeholder groups, i.e. researchers, engineers, policymakers, and partners.</li><li>Mission-driven mindset - you care deeply about how technology shapes society, and you’re excited by <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/openmined\">OpenMined</a>’s goal of unlocking the world’s non-public information.</li></ul><h3>Nice-to-Haves</h3><ul><li>Prior experience in early-stage or research-to-product environments.</li><li>Experience as a data scientist or building for data scientists (including experience using Colab and Jupyter)</li><li>Contributions to open-source projects or standards efforts.</li><li>Exposure/curiosity about public policy, privacy, or technology governance.</li><li>Entrepreneurial or founder-like experience - especially where you had to build both product and ecosystem from scratch.</li></ul><h3>Benefits</h3><ul><li>Mission-Driven Work: Be part of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization focused on social impact rather than profit, working toward a safer, more privacy-preserving AI ecosystem.</li><li>Open Source Contribution: Make a real impact by contributing to tools that empower global collaboration.</li><li>Collaborative Global Team: Join a small, ambitious, and international team that values clarity, candor, and creativity.</li><li>Flexible Work Hours: Structure your work around what best fits your life and productivity.</li><li>Fully Remote: Work from anywhere - no commute, no office politics.</li><li>Results-Driven Culture: We value autonomy, accountability, and results over bureaucracy.</li><li>Flexible Paid Time Off: Take time as you need it.</li><li>Competitive Compensation: Receive fair and transparent pay, equitable across regions.</li></ul><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",

We are currently seeking a Full Stack Product Engineer to join one of our <strong>clients</strong>' teams. If you're looking for an exciting opportunity to grow in a innovative environment, this could be the perfect fit for you. </p><p> They're building the infrastructure that makes hardware development as fast as software.</p><h3>Requirements</h3><p><strong>What you need- 3+ years building full-stack web applications end-to-end<br>- Strong at React + <a rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://Node.js\" target=\"_blank\">Node.js</a>. MongoDB experience is a great plus.<br>- Experience building complex applications - you understand clean architecture, security, scaling, performance, and maintainability</strong></p><h3><strong>- Solid data modeling fundamentals</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Product company experience (you've felt the joy and pain of real users)<br>- Some overlap with GMT+3 working hours so we can actually talk to you sometimes<br><strong><br>How they actually work- They’re a small remote team made up of the best of the best. Their team members are distributed around the globe. While most of their product and engineering talent is located in Europe and Israel, you’ll also work with people from the US and Asia. Most of their work is made async, which is the secret sauce of our success.<br><br>- High trust, low bullshit: They don't count hours or peek over your shoulder on Slack. They trust you to get your work done and tell when something's wrong. You'll have real ownership over what you build: which means you'll make a lot of decisions about architecture and functionality without endless approval cycles. (If that sounds terrifying, we're probably not a good fit. If that sounds exciting, keep reading.)<br><br>- Question everything: See something that doesn't make sense? Say it. Have a better way to do something? Just do it. We actually mean it when we say we want people to challenge the status quo and improve things. Our internal motto is “Don’t drink the kool-aid”<br><br>- No stupid Meetings: One weekly all-hands. One dev team sync. That's literally it. Everything else happens async in Slack or Loom. Your calendar will be beautifully, gloriously empty.<br><br>- Actually friendly, not corporate friendly: They play games online every week (current favorite: Make it Meme). Once a year they fly everyone somewhere beautiful for their offsite (Greece, here we come). They genuinely like hanging out together, which turns out to be way better than forced \"team building exercises.\"<strong><br><br>What they value in engineering:- Simple &gt; Complicated. Simple code, simple architecture; Simple solutions are better than complex ones.<br>- Ship it, then improve it. Perfection is the enemy of done. Launch now, iterate forever.<br>- Product &gt; Engineering. Every line of code should make our users' lives better. We're not here to show off our algorithmic prowess - we're here to solve real business problems.<strong><br><br>What we offer- A small team where you matter - we never compromise on people, that means you are part of the best team in the world.<br>- Zero bureaucracy - hate process theatre as much as you do<br>- Real ownership and responsibility - make decisions, ship code, own the outcomes. Have real impact on the product from day 1.<br>- Complete flexibility - work from anywhere, set your own hours, take time off when you need it (parents especially welcome)<br>- Genuinely high trust - trusting you to do great work and be honest when things go sideways<br>- A team that actually likes each other - international, diverse, genuinely friendly people who enjoy working together<br>- Generous stock options - looking for partners to run a marathon with us, you will get a life-changing shares when we get to the finish line<br>- Competitive Salary - salary varies based on location and level of experience<br>- Self-development budget for books, courses, conferences, whatever helps you grow<br>- Annual offsites in beautiful places<br>- Fast-paced environment with tons of creative freedom<br>- Hard, interesting problems with a team that's positioned to win big</strong></strong></strong></strong></li><strong><strong><strong>\n</strong></strong></strong></ul><p>Originally posted on <a href=\"https://himalayas.app\">Himalayas</a></p>",
